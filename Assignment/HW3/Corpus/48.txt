landspout  wikipedia a landspout is a term coined by meteorologist howard b bluestein in 1985 for a kind of tornado not associated with a mesocyclone 1 the glossary of meteorology defines a landspout as landspouts form during the growth stage of a cumulus congestus cloud by stretching boundary layer vorticity upward and into the cumulus congestus's updraft they generally are smaller and weaker than supercell tornadoes and do not form from a mesocyclone or pre-existing rotation in the cloud because of this landspouts are rarely detected by doppler weather radar 3 landspouts share a strong resemblance and development process to that of waterspouts usually taking the form of a translucent and highly laminar helical tube landspouts are considered tornadoes since a rotating column of air is in contact with both the surface and a cumuliform cloud not all landspouts are visible and many are first sighted as debris swirling at the surface before eventually filling in with condensation and dust a few landspouts can persist in excess of 15 minutes and have produced f3 damage 4 however they rarely produce damage greater than ef-2.[citation needed see also dust devil tornado waterspout vortex engine references  bluestein howard b 1985 the formation of a landspout in a broken-line squall line in oklahoma preprints 14th conf on severe local storms indianapolis american meteorological society pp 267270 retrieved 27 march 2007  american meteorological society 2000 glossary of meteorology second edition ametsoc org retrieved 27 march 2007  wakimoto wilson 1989 non-supercell tornadoes monthly weather review 117 11131140 bibcode:1989mwrv 117.1113w doi:10.1175 1520-0493 1989 117<1113:nst>2.0.co;2  forbes wakimoto 1983 a concentrated outbreak of tornadoes downbursts and microbursts and implications regarding vortex classification monthly weather review 111 220235 bibcode:1983mwrv 111..220f doi:10.1175 1520-0493 1983 111<0220:acootd>2.0.co;2 external links wikimedia commons has media related to landspout advanced spotters field guide online tornado faq
