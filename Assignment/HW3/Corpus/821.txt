season meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale the origins of hurricane diana were from a tropical wave that existed western africa into the atlantic on july 27 conditions were unfavorable for development of a tropical cyclone and the tropical wave remained disorganized until reaching the eastern caribbean sea the system entered the caribbean sea through the southern windward islands where falling barometric pressures were observed decreasing by 3.5 mbar hpa 0.1 inhg in 24 hours upper-level air data from the lesser antilles indicated that the tropical wave was associated with an upper-level anticyclone with increasing convection the first air force reconnaissance plane flight indicated no low-level circulation but a relatively large amount of thunderstorm activity the system continued to have a large amount of associated convection while passing over the netherlands antilles as indicated by satellite images and surface observations cyclonic rotation was observed in the low-level convection by satellite images and the fifth tropical depression of the season had developed at 0000 utc on august 4 situated in the southwestern caribbean sea however this was based on surface observations and it was not confirmed that tropical cyclone formation occurred until later that day 1 the new tropical depression

name diana to the system becoming a tropical storm diana further intensified and winds reached 65 mph 105 km h before landfall in felipe carrillo puerto in quintana roo occurred the storm initially rapidly weakened over land although it retained winds of 50 mph 80 km h until moving over open waters when diana entered the southern gulf of mexico the trough of low pressure in that vicinity weakened and steering currents caused the storm to head westward conditions became more favorable in the gulf of mexico and diana quickly intensified becoming a hurricane late on august 7 hurricane diana rapidly intensified and briefly reached category 2 hurricane status attaining peak intensity with winds of 100 mph 165 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar hpa 28.94 inhg only two
