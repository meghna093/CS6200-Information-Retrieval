subtropical cyclone  wikipedia a subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical and an extratropical cyclone 1 as early as the 1950s meteorologists were uncertain whether they should be characterized as tropical or extratropical cyclones they were officially recognized by the national hurricane center in 1972 subtropical cyclones have begun to receive names from the official tropical cyclone lists in the north atlantic south-west indian ocean and south atlantic basins there are two definitions currently used for subtropical cyclones across the north atlantic and southwest indian ocean they require central convection fairly near the center and a warming core in the mid-levels of the troposphere across the eastern half of the northern pacific they require a mid-tropospheric cyclone to cut off from the main belt of the westerlies and only a weak surface circulation subtropical cyclones have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones and have no weather fronts linked into their center 2 since they form from initially extratropical cyclones which have colder temperatures aloft than normally found in the tropics the sea surface temperatures required for their formation are lower than the tropical cyclone threshold by 3c 5f lying around 23 c 73 f this also means that subtropical cyclones are more likely to form outside the traditional bounds of the north atlantic hurricane season subtropical cyclones are also observed to form in the south atlantic south atlantic subtropical cyclones are observed in all months 3 history of term throughout the 1950s and 1960s the term semi-tropical and quasi-tropical were used for what would become known as subtropical cyclones 4 the term subtropical cyclone merely referred to any cyclone located in the subtropical belt near and just north of the horse latitudes intense debate ensued in the late 1960s after a number of hybrid cyclones formed in the atlantic basin in 1972 the national hurricane center nhc finally designated these storms as subtropical cyclones in real-time 5 and updated the hurricane database to include subtropical cyclones from 1968 through 1971 the term neutercane began to be used for small subtropical cyclones which formed from mesoscale features and the nhc began issuing public statements during the 1972 atlantic hurricane season employing that classification this name was not noted as controversial in contemporary news reports but it was dropped less than a year later recent articles published after the year 2000 have suggested that the name neutercane was considered sexist in the 1970s but there do not appear to be any published reports from that period making this claim 6 naming subtropical storm gustav in 2002 the first system to be given a name as a subtropical cyclone in the north atlantic basin subtropical cyclones were initially named from the nato phonetic alphabet list in the early to mid-1970s 5 in the intervening years of 19752001 subtropical storms were either named from the traditional list and considered tropical in real-time or used a separate numbering system between 1992 and 2001 two different numbers were given to subtropical depressions or subtropical storms one for public use the other one for nrl and nhc reference for example hurricane karen in 2001 was initially known as subtropical storm one as well as al1301 or 13l for short 7 in 2002 the nhc began giving numbers to subtropical depressions and names to subtropical storms from the same sequence as tropical cyclones from 2002 onwards subtropical depression 13l would be known as subtropical depression thirteen instead hurricane gustav of 2002 was the first subtropical storm to receive a name but became tropical shortly after naming subtropical storm nicole from the 2004 atlantic hurricane season was the first subtropical storm that did not become tropical since the policy change a subtropical storm from the 2005 atlantic hurricane season also did not become tropical but was not named since it was not recognized until post-season analysis 8 in the southern indian ocean subtropical cyclones are also named once winds reach tropical storm or gale force 9 since 2011 subtropical storms in the western south atlantic ocean are named by the brazilian navy hydrographic center 10 formation a water vapour loop showing the formation of subtropical storm andrea subtropical cyclones form in a wide band of latitude mainly south of the 50th parallel in the northern hemisphere 11 due to the increased frequency of cyclones which cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the summer and fall subtropical cyclones are significantly more frequent across the north atlantic than the northwestern pacific ocean 12 in the eastern half of the north pacific ocean and north indian ocean the older subtropical cyclone definition term is still used which requires a weak circulation forming underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season winter in the case of the north indian ocean the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season 13 in the southern hemisphere subtropical cyclones are regularly observed across southern portions of the mozambique channel 9 most subtropical cyclones form when a deep cold-core extratropical cyclone drops down into the subtropics the system becomes blocked by a high latitude ridge and eventually sheds its frontal boundaries as its source of cool and dry air from the high latitudes diverts away from the system temperature differences between the 500 hpa pressure level or 5,900 meters 19,400 ft above ground level and the sea surface temperatures initially exceed the dry adiabatic lapse rate which causes an initial round of thunderstorms to form at a distance east of the center due to the initial cold temperatures aloft sea surface temperatures usually need to reach at least 20 c 68 f for this initial round of thunderstorms the initial thunderstorm activity moistens up the environment around the low which destabilizes the atmosphere by reducing the lapse rate needed for convection when the next shortwave or upper level jet streak wind maximum within the jet stream moves nearby convection reignites closer to the center and the system develops into a true subtropical cyclone the average sea surface temperature that helps lead to subtropical cyclogenesis is 24 c 75 f 1]    [32 these
