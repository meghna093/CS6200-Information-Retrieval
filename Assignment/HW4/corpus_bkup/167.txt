typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion the ton of tnt is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4.184 gigajoules 1 which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton 1,000 kilograms or one megagram of tnt the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials of which tnt is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as dynamite contain more energy kiloton and megaton the kiloton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 terajoules the megaton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 petajoules the kiloton and megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a nuclear weapon the tnt equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid impact 2 historical derivation of the value a gram of tnt releases 26736702 j joules upon explosion 3 the energy liberated by one gram of tnt was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184 j 4 which is exactly one kilocalorie an explosive's energy is normally expressed as the thermodynamic work produced by its detonation which for tnt has been accurately measured as 4686 j g from a large sample of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 4853 j g 5 the measured pure heat output of a gram of tnt is only 2724 j 6]         [26 or 1.460 gigatons 1,460 million tons of tnt 62,500 73

stronger than each of the bombs that hit hiroshima and nagasaki and the most energetic event on the history of earth for hundreds of millions of years far more powerful than any volcanic eruption earthquake or firestorm such an explosion annihilated everything within a thousand miles of the impact in a split second such energy is equivalent to that needed to power the whole earth for several

relative effectiveness factor re factor relates an explosive's demolition power to that of tnt in units of the tnt equivalent kg tnte kg the re factor is the relative mass of tnt to which an explosive is equivalent the greater the re the more powerful the explosive this enables engineers to determine the proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for tnt for example if a timber-cutting formula calls for a charge of 1 kg of tnt then based on octanitrocubane's re factor of 2.38 it would take only 1.0 2.38 or 0.42 kg of it to do the same job using petn engineers would need 1.0 1.66 or 0.60 kg to obtain the same effects as 1 kg of tnt with anfo or ammonium nitrate they would require 1.0 0.74 or 1.35 kg or 1.0 0.42 or 2.38 kg respectively
