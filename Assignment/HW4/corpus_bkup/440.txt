corporation official website abc net au the australian broadcasting corporation abc is australia's national broadcaster funded by australian taxpayers but specifically independent of government and politics in the commonwealth the abc plays a leading role in journalistic independence and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in australia its model based on  but not restricted to  the bbc in the united kingdom originally financed in a similar method to the british model using consumer licence fees on broadcasting receivers its funding evolved to a projected model approved by the australian parliament in recent times the corporation provides television radio online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional australia as well as overseas through australia plus and radio australia origin founded in 1929 as the australian broadcasting company the abc was a government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system the a system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas whilst the b system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology following the general downward economic trends of the era as entrepreneurial ventures in national infrastructure struggled with viability the company was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 july 1932 and renamed as australian broadcasting commission re-aligning more closely to the british bbc model the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983                            [150 in 1965 abc graphics designer bill kennard who had been experimenting with telerecording of the cathode ray oscilloscope displays submitted a design which was part of the waveform from an oscilloscope the letters abc were added to the design and it was adopted as the abc's official logo kennard was presented with 25 for his design 149 since its original introduction in 1965 it has been updated several times including with the introduction of colour television in 1975 the line was thickened to feature colour in the logo the 1975 logo is the longest-running logo with a lifespan of 27 years in 2001 with the introduction of digital television in australia abc television adopted a modified version of the logo featuring a silver 3d look and losing the over and under design however despite the launch of this logo the 1975 logo is still used by the corporation in july 2002 to celebrate the abc's 70th anniversary the corporation adopted a new logo across all media this new logo still used the silver 3d colour but reverted to its over and under design in 2014 as part of abc1's renaming back into abc tv the 1975 logo was brought back to on-air presentation despite this the 2002 silver logo
