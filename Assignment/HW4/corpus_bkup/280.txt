[76 typhoon utor killed at least 78 people and left 49 others missing in the philippines 77 damages from the typhoon were estimated at 1.9 million 2006 usd 78 typhoon utor was blamed for heavy rains of up to 350 mm within 24 hours in southern peninsular malaysia specifically johor negeri sembilan melaka and pahang causing massive floods within the southern region on december 18 2006 which was considered as the worst in the malaysian southern region history 79 however there were also reports a few days earlier that adverse weather was not to be blamed on the typhoon 80 the worst-affected areas were segamat and kota tinggi where both towns were totally inaccessible by land after all main roads leading to those towns were all flooded 81 until december 24 2006 the floods had claimed 8 lives 82 tropical storm trami tomas tropical storm jma tropical depression sshws duration december 15  december 20 peak intensity 65 km h 40 mph 10-min 1000 hpa mbar on december 16 the japan meteorological agency started issuing public bulletins on a tropical depression southwest of guam the joint typhoon warning center initiated warnings on tropical depression 26w the next day despite having not issued a tropical cyclone formation alert the system was upgraded to a tropical storm by the jma and named trami which is a kind of rose tree this name was submitted by vietnam the storm moved west-northwest rapidly towards the philippines but struggled against wind shear and an approaching cold front entering the pagasa area of responsibility on december 18 as it maintained minimal tropical storm intensity it was named tomas the jtwc issued its final warning later that day having never upgraded the storm to tropical storm strength citing no indication of a significant low-level circulation centre on december 19 the jma downgraded the storm to a tropical depression and issued its last public bulletin as the storm dissipated over water other systems on march 7 the jma had upgraded a low-pressure area to a tropical depression formed by the remnants of 01w to the southeast of mindanao philippines 83 during the next day the system moved overland and made landfall over in davao 84 the system emerged to the sulu sea nearing palawan until it weakened back into a low-pressure are on march 10.[85 on march 11 the same system emerged to the south china sea as the jma had re-upgraded it back to a tropical depression 86 although the system had experienced shear and became an exposed system the depression fully dissipated late on march 12.[87 on july 3 both the china meteorological administration cma and the jma had identified a tropical depression about 200 km south of sanya hainan the depression moved northwest and made landfall a in hainan on the same day 88 the depression made its second landfall over in the border of northern vietnam and china as it rapidly deteriorated and absorbed by a front on july 4.[89 early on july 21 the cma classified it as a tropical depression the cma issued its final warning on july 22 as it started to weaken rapidly the system was absorbed by typhoon kaemi and fully dissipated on july 25 the jma only classified the system as a low-pressure area throughout its lifetime on july 28 a tropical depression had rapidly organized and persisted over in the gulf of tonkin and made landfall in the same location as the previous system at its peak strength with a pressure of 998 mbar 90 the system moved over land and fully dissipated on july 29.[91 on september 13 two tropical depressions were monitored by the jma 92 the first one persisted just south of hong kong and dissipated later on the same day 92 the second system formed from a stationary front near taiwan and moved northwards by september 15 the system dissipated while making landfall over in south korea 93 a trio of tropical depressions were also monitored by the jma during late october the first developed on october 21 about north of the mariana islands 94 the depression moved stationary until its circulation became exposed due to shear on october 23.[95 the other two systems were also monitored very briefly by the jma during october 22.[96 one in the south china sea as it moved westwards and fully dissipated six hours later where its remnants made landfall in vietnam during the next day whilst the other persisted over in the philippine sea also bringing rainfall to luzon during october 25 just before the arrival of typhoon cimaron 96 storm names see also tropical cyclone naming and history of tropical cyclone naming within the north-western pacific ocean both the japan meteorological agency jma and the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the western pacific which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names 97 the japan meteorological agency's rsmc tokyo  typhoon center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the world meteorological organization's typhoon committee should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km h 40 mph 98 while the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135e and 115e and between 5n-25n even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it 97 the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired by both pagasa and the typhoon committee 98 should the list of names for the philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season unused names are marked in gray international names main article list of retired pacific typhoon names during the season 22 tropical storms developed in the western pacific and each one was named by the jma when the system was judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km h 40 mph the jma selected the names from a list of 140 names that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the escap wmo typhoon committee after the season the typhoon committee retired the names chanchu bilis saomai xangsane and durian they were replaced with sanba maliksi son-tinh leepi and mangkhut respectively chanchu jelawat ewiniar bilis kaemi

or moved into their self-defined area of responsibility 99 the names were taken from a list of names that had been last used during 2002 and was scheduled to be used again during 2010.[99 many names were used for the first time as pagasa had revised their naming lists during 2003 although the name gloria from 2002 was retired and replaced with glenda as it was the name of the incumbent philippine president at that time 99 after the season pagasa had stated that the names milenyo and reming will be retired as they had caused over php1 billion in damages and over 300 fatalities they were subsequently replaced on the list with mario and ruby both names however were retired after the 2014 season being replaced by maymay and rosita respectively season effects this table summarizes all
