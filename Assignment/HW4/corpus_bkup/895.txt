[82 less than a year after the accident president bush announced the vision for space exploration calling for the space shuttle fleet to complete the iss with retirement by the year 2010 following the completion of the iss to be replaced by a newly developed crew exploration vehicle for travel to the moon and mars 83 nasa planned to return the space shuttle to service around september 2004 that date was pushed back to july 2005 on july 26 2005 at 10:39 am est space shuttle discovery cleared the tower on the return to flight mission sts-114 marking the shuttle's return to space overall the sts-114 flight was highly successful but a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed although the debris did not strike the orbiter due to this nasa once again grounded the shuttles until the remaining problem was understood and a solution implemented 55 after delaying their re-entry by two days due to adverse weather conditions commander eileen collins and pilot james m kelly returned discovery safely to earth on august 9 2005 later that same month the external tank construction site at michoud was damaged by hurricane katrina 84 at the time there was concern that this would set back further shuttle flights by at least two months and possibly more the actual cause of the foam loss on both columbia and discovery was not determined until december 2005 when x-ray photographs of another tank showed that thermal expansion and contraction during filling not human error caused cracks that led to foam loss nasa's hale formally apologized to the michoud workers who had been blamed for the loss of columbia for almost three years 14 the second return to flight mission sts-121 launched on july 4 2006 at 2:37:55 pm edt after two previous launch attempts were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad the launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head this mission increased the iss crew to three a 5-inch 130 mm crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern however the mission management team gave the go for launch 85 space shuttle discovery touched down successfully on july 17 2006 at 9:14:43 am edt on runway 15 at the kennedy space center on august 13 2006 nasa announced that sts-121 had shed more foam than they had expected while this did not delay the launch for the next mission  sts-115 originally set to lift off on august 27 86  the weather and other technical glitches did with a lightning strike hurricane ernesto and a faulty fuel tank sensor combining to delay the launch until september 9 on september 19 landing was delayed an extra day to examine atlantis after objects were found floating near the shuttle in the same orbit when no damage was detected atlantis landed successfully on september 21 the columbia crew survival investigation report released by nasa on december 30 2008 made further recommendations to improve a crew's survival chances on future space vehicles such as the planned orion spacecraft these included improvements in crew restraints finding ways to deal more effectively with catastrophic cabin depressurization more graceful degradation of vehicles during a disaster so that crews will have a better chance at survival and automated parachute systems 59 sociocultural aftermath fears of terrorism after the shuttle's breakup there were some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved but no evidence of that has ever surfaced 87 security surrounding the launch and landing of the space shuttle had been increased because the crew included the first israeli astronaut 88 the merritt island launch facility like all sensitive government areas had increased security after the september 11 attacks purple streak image the san francisco chronicle reported that an amateur astronomer had taken a five-second exposure that appeared to show a purplish line near the shuttle resembling lightning during re-entry 89 the caib report concluded that the image was the result of camera vibrations during a long-exposure 90 2003 armageddon film hoax in response to the disaster fx canceled its scheduled airing two nights later of the 1998 film armageddon in which the space shuttle atlantis is depicted as being destroyed by asteroid fragments 91 in a hoax inspired by the destruction of columbia some images that were purported to be satellite photographs of the shuttle's explosion turned out to be screen captures from the space shuttle destruction scene of armageddon music the 2003 album bananas by deep purple includes contact lost an instrumental piece written by guitarist steve morse in remembrance of the loss morse is donating his songwriting royalties to the families of the astronauts 92 catherine faber and callie hills the folk group known as echo's children included a memorial song titled columbia on their 2004 album from the hazel tree 93 the 2005 album ultimatum  ep by the long winters contains the song the commander thinks aloud which was songwriter singer john roderick's musing on the crew's perspective of the unexpected catastrophe 94 in addition the january 30 2015 episode of hrishikesh hirway's song exploder podcast presented an interview with john roderick about the songwriting and recording process for the commander thinks aloud 95 swiss post-rock band the evpatoria report used the records of radio communication between columbia and capcom as a sample for their instrumental song taijin kyofusho on their 2005 album golevka the hungarian composer peter etvs wrote a piece named seven for solo violin and orchestra in 2006 in memory of the crew of columbia seven was premiered in 2007 by violinist akiko suwanai conducted by pierre boulez and it was recorded in 2012 with violinist patricia kopatchinskaja and the composer conducting 96 the 2008 album columbia we dare to dream by anne cabrera was written as a tribute to space shuttle columbia sts-107 the crew support teams recovery teams and the crew's families 97 a copy of the album on compact disc was flown aboard space shuttle discovery mission sts-131 to the international space station by astronaut clayton anderson in april 2010.[98 the scottish folk-rock band runrig included a song entitled somewhere on their album the story 2016 the song was dedicated to laurel clark who had become a fan of the band during her navy service in scotland and includes a piece of her wake up song followed by some radio chatter at the end 99 see also united states portal
