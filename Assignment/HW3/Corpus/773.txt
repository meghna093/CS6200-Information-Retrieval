opinions of historians political scientists and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents the survey respondents gave president bush low ratings on his handling of the u s economy communication ability to compromise foreign policy accomplishments and intelligence 448 among the public his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009 in february 2012 gallup reported that americans still rate george w bush among the worst presidents though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office 449 gallup had earlier noted that bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office from 40 percent in january 2009 and 35 percent in march 2009 to 45 percent in july 2010 a period during which he had remained largely out of the news 450 other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency 451 in april 2013 bush's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for the washington post and abc his highest approval rating since december 2005 bush had achieved notable gains among seniors non-college whites and moderate and conservative democrats since leaving office although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy 53 percent and the iraq war 57 percent 452 his 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of president obama's in the same polling period 453 a cnn poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of americans said bush's presidency had been a failure with opinions divided along party lines and 43 percent of independents calling it a success 454 see also biography portal conservatism portal government of
