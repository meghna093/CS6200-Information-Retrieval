for the soviet space program by the korolev design bureau now rkk energia in the 1960s that remains in service today the soyuz succeeded the voskhod spacecraft and was originally built as part of the soviet manned lunar programs the soyuz spacecraft is launched on a soyuz rocket the most frequently used and most reliable launch vehicle in the world to date 1]    [16 more efficient solar panels modified docking and attitude control engine positions for redundancy during docking and de-orbit burns new kurs na approach and docking system which weighs half as much and consumes a third of the power of previous system new tsvm-101 computer about one eighth the weight 8.3 kg vs 70 kg and much smaller than the previous argon-16 computer[17 unified digital command telemetry system mbits to relay telemetry via satellite and control spacecraft when out of sight of ground stations also provides the crew with position data when out of ground tracking range[17 glonass gps and cospas-sarsat satellite systems for more accurate location during search rescue operations after landing the soyuz ms-02 spacecraft had its maiden flight on october 19 2016 to launch expedition 49-50 from baikonur with three crew members 18 related craft the unmanned progress spacecraft were derived from soyuz and are used for servicing space stations while not being direct derivatives of soyuz the chinese
