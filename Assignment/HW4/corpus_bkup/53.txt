parts of the united states as a silver thaw 1 the u s national weather service defines an ice storm as a storm which results in the accumulation of at least 0.25-inch 6.4 mm of ice on exposed surfaces 2 from 1982 to 1994 ice storms were more common than blizzards and averaged 16 per year 3 they are generally not violent storms but instead are commonly perceived as gentle rains occurring at temperatures just below freezing formation a graph showing the formation of different kinds of precipitation the formation of ice begins with a layer of above-freezing air above a layer of sub-freezing temperatures closer to the surface frozen precipitation melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below if the precipitate refreezes while still in the air it will land on the ground as sleet alternatively the liquid droplets can continue to fall without freezing passing through the cold air just above the surface this thin layer of air then cools the rain to a temperature below freezing 0 c or 32 f however the drops themselves do not freeze a phenomenon called supercooling or forming supercooled drops when the supercooled drops strike ground or anything else below 0 c 32 f e g power lines tree branches aircraft a layer of ice accumulates as the cold water drips off forming a slowly thickening film of ice hence freezing rain 4]   [17 during the unusually severe winter of 200910 in great britain and ireland heavy snow had fallen over much of the country in late december and early january by the second week of january many of the roads and pavements had been cleared by local councils due to the use of rock salt gritting however during the early hours of january 12 a wet front[clarification needed moved across the country causing freezing rain and heavy ice glaze particularly in the south and west yorkshire areas of northern england crucially this rainfall had stopped before first light when the local population prepared to set out for work and school they saw from their windows what appeared to be clear roads and pavements but were in fact treacherous sheets of black ice cars and buses almost immediately encounted extreme difficulty and emergency services were called to dozens of accidents pedestrians in the village of holmfirth found the only safe way to proceed was to crawl on all fours 18 accident and emergency units at hospitals in the sheffield rotherham and barnsley areas found themselves inundated by people with broken bones fractures and sprains and many schools were closed as it was judged unsafe for pupils to attempt to make their way there on december 25 2010 freezing rain fell on moscow and its vicinity the glaze ice accumulation caused a number of accidents and power outages of which the most serious was damage caused to two power lines feeding domodedovo airport causing a complete blackout of the airport and express railway that connected it to the city as a result the airport was shut down and hundreds of passengers were stranded inside with taxi drivers charging up to 10,000 rubles usd 330 for a one-hour drive to the city 19 other city airports sheremetyevo and vnukovo where air traffic was re-routed and amid heavy snowfall that followed ice rain collapsed a day later causing a full air transport collapse gallery a tree covered in ice from
