light  wikipedia visible light redirects here for light that cannot be seen with human eye see electromagnetic radiation for other uses see light disambiguation and visible light disambiguation light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum the word usually refers to visible light which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight 1 visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres nm or 4.00  107 to 7.00  107 m between the infrared with longer wavelengths and the ultraviolet with shorter wavelengths 2]        [31 descartes ren descartes 15961650 held that light was a mechanical property of the luminous body rejecting the forms of ibn al-haytham and witelo as well as the species of bacon grosseteste and kepler 32 in 1637 he published a theory of the refraction of light that assumed incorrectly that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves citation needed although descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media descartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium descartes theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics 32 particle theory main article corpuscular theory of light pierre gassendi pierre gassendi 15921655 an atomist proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s isaac newton studied gassendi's work at an early age and preferred his view to descartes theory of the plenum he stated in his hypothesis of light of 1675 that light was composed of corpuscles particles of matter which were emitted in all directions from a source one of newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles while light travelled only in straight lines he did however explain the phenomenon of the diffraction of light which had been observed by francesco grimaldi by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the aether newton's theory could be used to predict the reflection of light but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater newton published the final version of his theory in his opticks of 1704 his reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the 18th century the particle theory of light led laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it in other words it would become what is now called a black hole laplace withdrew his suggestion later after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light as has been explained neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct a translation of newton's essay on light appears in the large scale structure of space-time by stephen hawking and george f r ellis the fact that light could be polarized was for the first time qualitatively explained by newton using the particle theory tienne-louis malus in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization jean-baptiste biot in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization at that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory wave theory to explain the origin of colors robert hooke 1635-1703 developed a pulse theory and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work micrographia observation ix in 1672 hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be perpendicular to the direction of propagation christiaan huygens 1629-1695 worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678 and published it in his treatise on light in 1690 he proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the luminiferous ether as waves are not affected by gravity it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium 33 christiaan huygens thomas young's sketch of a double-slit experiment showing diffraction young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves the wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves as noted around 1800 by thomas young young showed by means of a diffraction experiment that light behaved as waves he also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye another supporter of the wave theory was leonhard euler he argued in nova theoria lucis et colorum 1746 that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory in 1816 andr-marie ampre gave augustin-jean fresnel an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a transverse wave 34 later fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light and presented it to the acadmie des sciences in 1817 simon denis poisson added to fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favour of the wave theory helping to overturn newton's corpuscular theory by the year 1821 fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarisation could be explained by the wave theory of light and only if light was entirely transverse with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever the weakness of the wave theory was that light waves like sound waves would need a medium for transmission the existence of the hypothetical substance luminiferous aether proposed by huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the michelsonmorley experiment newton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium while the wave theory of huygens and others implied the opposite at that time the speed of light could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct the first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was lon foucault in 1850.[35 his result supported the wave theory and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century electromagnetic theory main article electromagnetic radiation a 3dimensional rendering of linearly polarised light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light an electric field and a magnetic field perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion a transverse wave in 1845 michael faraday discovered that the plane of polarisation of linearly polarised light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric an effect now known as faraday rotation 36 this was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism in 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines 36 faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether citation needed faraday's work inspired james clerk maxwell to study electromagnetic radiation and light maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light from this maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation he first stated this result in 1862 in on physical lines of force in 1873 he published a treatise on electricity and magnetism which contained a full mathematical description of the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields still known as maxwell's equations soon after heinrich hertz confirmed maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light exhibiting properties such as reflection refraction diffraction and interference maxwell's theory and hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio radar television electromagnetic imaging and wireless communications in the quantum theory photons are seen as wave packets of the waves described in the classical theory of maxwell the quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that maxwell's classical theory could not such as spectral lines quantum theory in 1900 max planck attempting to explain black body radiation suggested that although light was a wave these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency planck called these lumps of light energy quanta from a latin word for how much in 1905 albert einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had a real existence in 1923 arthur holly compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity x-rays scattered from electrons so called compton scattering could be explained by a particle-theory of x-rays but not a wave theory in 1926 gilbert n lewis named these light quanta particles photons 37 eventually the modern theory of quantum mechanics came to picture light as in some sense both a particle and a wave and in another sense as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave which actually are macroscopic phenomena such as baseballs or ocean waves instead modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor particles and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor water waves but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined as in the case for radio waves and the x-rays involved in compton scattering physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other visible light which occupies a middle ground in frequency can easily be shown in experiments to be
