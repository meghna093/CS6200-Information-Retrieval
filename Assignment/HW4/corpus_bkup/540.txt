[72 28 august 1975 a train hauled by locomotive no 7 typhoon was in collision with a car on st mary's road level crossing dymchurch the car a ford corsair was destroyed and one of its occupants had to be cut free having been trapped by her feet but was not seriously injured the train driver cyril carter was uninjured the occupants of the car were a local young brother and sister roger piper 20 and belinda piper 14 driving to the fish and chip shop and witnesses reported that they had seen the approaching train but tried to race it to the level crossing their father john piper was quoted in the local newspaper as having said funnily enough it is nearly always someone local who is involved referring to accidents on dymchurch's level crossings 70 11 may 1993 a train propelled by locomotive no 12 john southland driven by stuart barratt was in collision with a white van at eastbridge road level crossing dymchurch the train was an empty coaching stock ecs working which had earlier operated the daily school service for pupils returning home from new romney the locomotive was propelling from the rear and the leading vehicle was driving van trailer dvt no 105 the transit van and the railway dvt both fell into the dyke beside the road the van driver was uninjured the guard simon oldfield who was travelling in the dvt was briefly trapped under water but was able to free himself and swim to safety the dvt was heavily damaged and had to be completely rebuilt during this rebuild it was adapted to become the railway's first wheelchair accessible coach two other passenger coaches 804 and 807 were also seriously damaged in the incident the van driver admitted fault but claimed that his brakes had failed the subsequent police investigation revealed that the brakes had operated correctly but that the van driver had vainly hoped to beat the train to the crossing police also found that the van's tyres were bald and that it had no current road tax a large crane recovered both vehicles from the water 73 3 august 2003 a train hauled by locomotive no 5 hercules was in collision with a car at burmarsh road level crossing protected by flashing warning lights 74 the engine driver 31-year-old kevin crouch died at the scene and some passengers were treated for shock and minor injuries the locomotive was seriously damaged and underwent extensive repairs returning to service in 2005 the female car driver 22-year old marie scrace[75 whose baby was a passenger in the vehicle had ignored or failed to see the warning lights scrace and her baby were taken to hospital but were not badly hurt the railway and the health and safety executive instigated an investigation and the woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving although acquitted she was found guilty of the lesser charge of careless driving 76 10 july 2005 a train hauled by locomotive no 8 hurricane was in collision with a car at battery road level crossing near dungeness the driver of the train suzanne martin the wife of the railway's general manager was killed 77 several passengers were treated for shock the locomotive was seriously damaged and underwent extensive repairs returning to service the following year the car driver 20-year old richard isted had ignored or failed to see warning lights and was arrested at the scene by kent police he subsequently appeared in court charged with driving without due care and attention to which he pleaded guilty 78 10 september 2016 a passenger train was struck by a tractor pulling a heavily laden hay trailer on occupation crossing number 10 approximately half a mile north of dymchurch station locomotive no 1 green goddess and its tender were both derailed and thrown onto their sides the leading coach was also derailed but remained upright the train driver and four passengers sustained minor injuries 79 level crossings following the two fatal accidents in 2003 and 2005 the railway began a programme of level crossing refurbishment there are a number of occupation crossings with local control where the railway meets farm tracks but of the eighteen junctions of the railway with public highways five are road bridges and the other thirteen are level crossings during the late 1970s to early 1980s all thirteen had been converted to automatic open crossings aocls [80 by installation of flashing warning lights between 2006 and 2016 twelve of them were upgraded to automatic barrier crossing locally monitored abcl status this involved the decommissioning of the life expired aocl control equipment the installation of lifting half-barriers and totally new control and train detection systems at a cost of around 90,000 per crossing 77 on 22nd of march 2017 the crossing at romney sands was commissioned as an abcl this means that all the 13 crossings on the line have barriers and it brought the level crossing upgrade program to a close during the single line crossing upgrades the road signal heads wig wags have either been replaced with new ones battery road and dungeness road or had their existing heads refurbished ownership and operation ownership the railway is owned by romney hythe  dymchurch railway plc which was originally incorporated as a private limited company on 15 november 1971 under the name rh&d light railway holding company limited adopting its present title on re-registration as a new public limited company under section 8 3 of the companies act 1980 on 10 may 1982.[81 its shareholders of whom there are now over a thousand travel free of charge on trains but receive no financial dividend on their shareholdings instead re-investing all operating profit back into the company at 14 june 2015 there were 25 gold medallion shareholders owning 5,000 or more shares each and 119 silver medallion shareholders owning between 500 and 4,999 shares each the remaining shareholders owned between 100 and 499 shares each the plc's issued and fully paid share capital at that date was 508,858 in 1 ordinary shares 82 shares in the plc remain available to the public at a cost of 4 each the minimum holding is 100 shares but above this number potential shareholders may purchase any amount further details can be obtained from the company secretary romney hythe  dymchurch railway plc new romney station new romney kent tn28 8pl the two largest shareholders in the plc are the romney hythe  dymchurch railway association with 78,604 shares 15.45 and sir william mcalpine bt leader of the consortium which saved the railway from closure in 1972 who holds 38,837 7.63 82 the plc controls the entire share capital of the older statutory romney hythe  dymchurch light railway company incorporated by the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway order 1926 it acquired a controlling interest in the statutory company on 14 february 1972 for 106,947.64 when it purchased 50,447 of the 51,000 statutory company shares then in issue 1 since february 1972 it has bought out all of the minority shareholders in the statutory company which is now a wholly owned subsidiary the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway amendment order 1974[83 altered the capital structure of the statutory company allowing its issued share capital and borrowings to amount in aggregate to 400,000 instead of the previously completely inadequate 68,000 on 1 october 1975 the statutory company created a further 24,000 new shares bringing its issued capital up to 75,000 in 1 shares the plc subscribed for 23,950 of these new shares and the remaining 50 were acquired by a director of the statutory company in order to bring their holding up to the minimum for directors of 250 shares specified in the 1926 light railway order 84 directors shareholdings in the statutory company are subject to rights of pre-emption by the plc and are therefore treated for most purposes as being owned by that company it is usual for the two companies to share the same board of directors with the anomaly that whilst the romney hythe  dymchurch railway association has been granted a seat on the statutory company's board it has no direct representation on the plc's board directors the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway order 1926 85 restricted the maximum number of directors of the statutory company to five and named captain john edwards presgrave howey gladys may howey captain john alexander holder major william bertram bell and henry greenly as the first directors greenly never owned more than 50 shares in the company so was ineligible to sit on the board and holder did not achieve the qualifying holding of 250 shares until 30 december 1929.[1 gladys howey was also ineligible until 1931 when her shareholding reached 250 and she was able to join the board section 5 of the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway amendment order 1974 83 increased the maximum number of directors from five to 10 and also set the minimum number of directors at three operation the day-to-day operation of the railway is in the hands of a full-time permanent staff of around 35 assisted by 5 part-time permanent staff 86 these include a general manager departmental managers engineering commercial and operations and a large number of engineering staff from locomotive fitters to permanent way gangers and catering staff the new romney and dungeness cafes and the light railway restaurant adjoining hythe station are open all year round some of the railway's other commercial outlets are more seasonal in addition to this core staff seasonal employees are taken on through the summer season particularly to increase the staffing of the shops and catering outlets and to provide the required levels of staffing at stations at the height of the operating season there are over 60 staff on the payroll 1 the railway depends upon a dedicated team of fully trained but unpaid volunteer staff members who work on the railway in their own spare time volunteer staff work
