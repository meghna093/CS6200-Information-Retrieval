and number 10 in belgium ultratop flanders in a review for pitchfork nathan reese wrote reading interviews with halsey you get the sense of a canny and talented performer one who legitimately wants to connect with fans but the public persona only comes through on badlands in fits and starts and there isn't a single subversive or original second on the album  about the chorus on new americana he commented like most of badlands it's calculated defiant and ultimately hollow 20 in a short review rolling stone's joe levy called halsey a new popstar with a knack for sticky imagery 21 the album was included at number six on rock sound's top 50 releases of 2015 list 27 track listing badlands  standard edition[28 no title writer s producer s length 1 castle ashley frangipane peder losnegrd lido
