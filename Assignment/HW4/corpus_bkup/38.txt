names outline of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones portal v t e a storm surge or storm tide is a coastal flood or tsunami-like phenomenon of rising water commonly associated with low pressure weather systems such as tropical cyclones and strong extratropical cyclones the severity of which is affected by the shallowness and orientation of the water body relative to storm path as well as the timing of tides most casualties during tropical cyclones occur as the result of storm surges it is a measure of the rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement related to tides the two main meteorological factors contributing to a storm surge are a long fetch of winds spiraling inward toward the storm and a low-pressure-induced dome of water drawn up under and trailing the storm's center historic storm surges total destruction of the bolivar peninsula texas by hurricane ike's storm surge in 2008 the deadliest storm surge on record was the 1970 bhola cyclone which killed up to 500,000 people in the area of the bay of bengal the low-lying coast of the bay of bengal is particularly vulnerable to surges caused by tropical cyclones 1 the deadliest storm surge in the twenty-first century was caused by the cyclone nargis which killed more than 138,000 people in myanmar in may 2008 the next deadliest in this century was caused by the typhoon haiyan yolanda which killed more than 6,000 people in the central philippines in 2013      [29 and the united kingdom 30 a prophylactic method introduced after the north sea flood of 1953 is the construction of dams and storm-surge barriers flood barriers they are open and allow free passage but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge major storm surge barriers are the oosterscheldekering and maeslantkering in the netherlands which are part of the delta works project the thames barrier protecting london and the saint petersburg dam in russia another modern development in use in the netherlands is the creation of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures restrained in position by vertical pylons 31 such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion for mainland areas storm surge is more of a threat when the storm strikes land from seaward rather than approaching from landward 32 reverse storm surge water can also be sucked away from shore prior to a storm surge this was the case on the western florida coast in 2017 just before hurricane irma made landfall uncovering land usually underwater 33 this phenomenon is known as a reverse storm surge 34 or a negative storm surge 35 see also meteotsunami tsunami-proof building notes references anthes richard a 1982 tropical cyclones their evolution structure and effects meteorological monographs bulletin
