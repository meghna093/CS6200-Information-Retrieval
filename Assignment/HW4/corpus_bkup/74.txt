atmospheric convection  wikipedia atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere different lapse rates within dry and moist air lead to instability mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds cumulus cloud development and decreased surface dew points moist convection leads to thunderstorm development which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world special threats from thunderstorms include hail downbursts and tornadoes overview there are a few general archetypes of atmospheric instability that are used to explain convection or lack thereof a necessary but not sufficient condition for convection is that the environmental lapse rate the rate of decrease of temperature with height is steeper than the lapse rate experienced by a rising parcel of air when this condition is met upward-displaced air parcels can become buoyant and thus experience a further upward force buoyant convection begins at the level of free convection lfc above which an air parcel may ascend through the free convective layer fcl with positive buoyancy its buoyancy turns negative at the equilibrium level el but the parcel's vertical momentum may carry it to the maximum parcel level mpl where the negative buoyancy decelerates the parcel to a stop integrating the buoyancy force over the parcel's vertical displacement yields convective available potential energy cape the joules of energy available per kilogram of potentially buoyant air cape is an upper limit for an ideal undilute parcel and the square root of twice the cape is sometimes called a thermodynamic speed limit for updrafts based on the simple kinetic energy equation however such buoyant acceleration concepts give an oversimplified view of convection drag is an opposite force to counter buoyancy 1 so that parcel ascent occurs under a balance of forces like the terminal velocity of a falling object buoyancy may be reduced by entrainment which dilutes the parcel with environmental air see the cape buoyancy and parcel links for a more in depth mathematical explanation of these processes atmospheric convection is called deep when it extends from near the surface to above the 500 hpa level generally stopping at the tropopause at around 200 hpa 1 most atmospheric deep convection occurs in the tropics as the rising branch of the hadley circulation and represents a strong local coupling between the surface and the upper troposphere which is largely absent in winter midlatitudes its counterpart in the ocean deep convection downward in the water column only occurs at a few locations 2 while less dynamically important than in the atmosphere such oceanic convection is responsible for the worldwide existence of cold water in the lowest layers of the ocean initiation a thermal column or thermal is a vertical section of rising air in the lower altitudes of the earth's atmosphere thermals are created by the uneven heating of the earth's surface from solar radiation the sun warms the ground which in turn warms the air directly above it the warmer air expands becoming less dense than the surrounding air mass and creating a thermal low 3]   [24 tornadoes despite being one of the most destructive weather phenomena are generally short-lived a long-lived tornado generally lasts no more than an hour but some have been known to last for 2 hours or longer for example the tri-state tornado due to their relatively short duration less information is known about the development and formation of tornadoes 25 measurement the potential for convection in the atmosphere is often measured by an atmospheric temperature dewpoint profile with height this is often displayed on a skew-t chart or other similar thermodynamic diagram these can be plotted by a measured sounding analysis which is the sending of a radiosonde attached to a balloon into the atmosphere to take the measurements with height forecast models can also create these diagrams but are less accurate due to model uncertainties and biases and have lower spatial resolution although the temporal resolution of forecast model soundings is greater than the direct measurements where the former can have plots for intervals of up to every 3 hours and the latter as having only 2 per day although when a convective event is expected a special sounding might be taken outside of the normal schedule of 00z and then 12z  2 other forecasting concerns atmospheric convection can also be responsible for and have implications on a number of other weather conditions a few examples on the smaller scale would include convection mixing the planetary boundary layer pbl and allowing drier air aloft to the surface thereby decreasing dew points creating cumulus-type clouds which can limit a small amount of sunshine increasing surface winds making outflow boundaries and other smaller boundaries more diffuse and the eastward propagation of the dryline during the day on the larger scale rising of air can lead to warm core surface lows often found in the desert southwest see also
