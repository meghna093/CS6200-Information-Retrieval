weather forecasting the study of meteorology dates back millennia though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century the 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data it wasn't until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and more particularly the development of the computer allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved meteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of earth's atmosphere temperature air pressure water vapor mass flow and the variations and interactions of those variables and how they change over time different spatial scales are used to describe and predict weather on local regional and global levels meteorology climatology atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry are sub-disciplines of the atmospheric sciences meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology the interactions between earth's atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere system meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military energy production transport agriculture and construction the word meteorology is from greek  metros lofty high in the sky from  meta above and  aeiro i lift up and  logia o logy i e the study of things in the air history main article timeline of meteorology parhelion sundog in savoie the ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests cuneiform inscriptions on babylonian tablets included associations between thunder and rain the chaldeans differentiated the 22 and 46 halos 1 ancient indian upanishads contain mentions of clouds and seasons 2 the samaveda mentions sacrifices to be performed when certain phenomena were noticed 1 varhamihira's classical work brihatsamhita written about 500 ad 2 provides evidence of weather observation in 350 bc aristotle wrote meteorology 3 aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology 4 one of the most impressive achievements described in the meteorology is the description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle 5 the book de mundo composed before 250 bc or between 350 and 200 bc noted              [85 on an everyday basis people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and wind chill forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead and survive them aviation meteorology aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on air traffic management it is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft as noted by the aeronautical information manual 86 the effects of ice on aircraft are cumulativethrust is reduced drag increases lift lessens and weight increases the results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance in extreme cases 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes it takes but 1 2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage 87 agricultural meteorology meteorologists soil scientists agricultural hydrologists and agronomists are persons concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution crop yield water-use efficiency phenology of plant and animal development and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems conversely they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather 88 hydrometeorology hydrometeorology is the branch of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle the water budget and the rainfall statistics of storms 89 a hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating quantitative precipitation heavy rain heavy snow and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology mesoscale and synoptic meteorology and other geosciences 90 the multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently be optimized for different hard and software platforms and use different data formats there are some initiatives  such as the drihm project[91  that are trying to address this issue 92 nuclear meteorology nuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of radioactive aerosols and gases in the atmosphere 93 maritime meteorology maritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for
