european windstorm  wikipediathis article is about storms crossing the atlantic ocean eastward and striking europe it is not to be confused with storms arising within europe or elsewhere and striking europe conceptual model for a european windstorm and the associated strong wind footprints note that storm track footprint locations and footprint sizes vary by case and that all footprints are not always present 1 european windstorm is a name given to the strongest extratropical cyclones which occur across the continent of europe 2 they form as cyclonic windstorms associated with areas of low atmospheric pressure they are most common in the autumn and winter months on average the month when most windstorms form is january the seasonal average is 4.6 windstorms 3 deep low pressure areas are relatively common over the north atlantic sometimes starting as nor'easters off the new england coast and frequently track across the north atlantic ocean towards western europe past the north coast of britain and ireland and into the norwegian sea however when they track further south they can affect almost any country in europe commonly affected countries include the united kingdom ireland the netherlands norway the faroe islands and iceland but any country in central europe northern europe and especially western europe is occasionally struck by such a storm system the strong wind phenomena intrinsic to european windstorms that give rise to damage footprints at the surface can be placed into three categories namely the warm jet the cold jet and the sting jet these phenomena vary in terms of physical mechanisms atmospheric structure spatial extent duration severity level predictability and location relative to cyclone and fronts 1 on average these storms cause economic damage 1.9 billion per year and insurance losses of 1.4 billion per year 19901998 they rank as the second highest cause of global natural catastrophe insurance loss after u s hurricanes 4 nomenclature naming of individual storms up to the second half of the 19th century european windstorms were named after the person who spotted them citation needed usually they would be named either by the year the date the saint's day of their occurrence            [46 a similar situation was reported in the wake of storm angus in 2016 though not linked specifically to the storm when reactor 1 at torness nuclear power station in scotland was taken offline after a sea water intake tripped due to excess seaweed around the inlet 47 also following storm angus the uk's national grid launched an investigation into whether a ship's anchor damaged four of the eight cables of the cross channel high voltage interconnector which would leave it only able to operate at half of its capacity until february 2017.[48

lost when the car ferry mv princess victoria sank in the north channel east of belfast north sea flood of 1962  the storm reached the german coast of the north sea with wind speeds up to 200 km h the accompanying storm surge combined with the high tide pushed water up the weser and elbe breaching dikes and caused extensive flooding especially in hamburg 315 people were killed around 60,000 were left homeless gale of january 1976 january 25 1976  widespread wind damage was reported across europe from ireland to central europe coastal flooding occurred in the united kingdom belgium and germany

speeds of 70 knots an average over 10 minutes were recorded the highest gust of 117 knots 217 km h was recorded at pointe du raz in brittany in all 19 people were killed in england and 4 in france 15 million trees were uprooted in england 1990 storm series  between 25 january and 1 march 1990 eight severe storms crossed europe including the burns day storm daria vivian  wiebke the total costs

gust speeds recorded at alto de ordua 228 km h 142 mph 50 people were reported to have died 54 recent storms 201314 atlantic winter storms in europe saw a conveyor belt series of high-precipitation storms mostly unexceptional for their winds explosively deepened by a strong jet stream the repeated formation of large deep lows over the atlantic brought storm surges and large waves which coincided with some of the highest astronomical tides of the year and led to coastal damage the low pressure areas brought heavy rainfalls and flooding which became most severe over parts of england such as at
