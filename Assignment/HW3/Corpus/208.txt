south atlantic tropical cyclone  wikipedia south atlantic tropical cyclones are unusual weather events that occur in the southern hemisphere strong wind shear which disrupts the formation of cyclones as well as a lack of weather disturbances favorable for development in the south atlantic ocean make any strong tropical system extremely rare and catarina in 2004 was the only recorded south atlantic hurricane in history those storms have only developed during the months from november through to april in this basin since 2011 the brazilian navy hydrographic center has started to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in western side of this basin near brazil when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km h 40 mph the generally accepted minimum sustained wind velocity for a disturbance to be designated as a tropical storm in the north atlantic basin below is a list of notable south atlantic tropical and subtropical cyclones theories concerning infrequency of occurrence until april 1991 it was thought that tropical cyclones did not develop within the south atlantic 1 very strong vertical wind shear in the troposphere is considered a deterrent 2 the intertropical convergence zone drops one to two degrees south of the equator 3 not far enough from the equator for the coriolis force to aid development water temperatures in the tropics of the southern atlantic are cooler than those in the tropical north atlantic 4 during april 1991 these assertions were proven false when the united states national hurricane center reported that a tropical cyclone had developed over the eastern south atlantic 1]               [65 storm names the following names are published by the brazilian navy hydrographic center and used for named storms that form in the area west of 20w and south of equator in the south atlantic ocean since 2011 arani is confirmed to be used again in the future after its next nine names are all used but it is unclear if those names will be also rotated 11 arani bapo cari deni ea guar unused iba unused jaguar unused kamby unused mani unused listed by month there have over 25 recorded tropical and subtropical cyclones in the south atlantic ocean since 1974 like most southern hemisphere cyclone seasons all storms have formed from november to april see also tropical cyclones portal wikimedia commons has media related to south atlantic tropical cyclones unusual areas of tropical cyclone formation list of tropical cyclone records list of south america tropical cyclones southern hemisphere tropical cyclone atlantic hurricane north atlantic tropical cyclone atlantic equatorial mode mediterranean tropical-like cyclone tropical cyclone basins 2006 central pacific cyclone 1996 lake huron cyclone references external links wikimedia commons has media related to south atlantic tropical cyclones brazilian navy hydrography center  marine meteorological service noaa info on south atlantic tropical cyclones cimss satellite blog another tropical cyclone in the south atlantic ocean meteogroup weathercast do hurricanes form in the south atlantic v t e south atlantic tropical and subtropical cyclones ts 1991 angola 2 catarina ts anita ss arani ss bapo ss cari ss deni ss ea
