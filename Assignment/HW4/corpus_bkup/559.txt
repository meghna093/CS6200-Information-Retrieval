layered vocals and nimble acoustic guitars 7 according to rashod d ollison of the washington post hurricane is lush in spots the overall sound more in the adult contemporary vein more christopher cross less r kelly 7 reception allmusic writer stephen thomas erlewine gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars and commented that the quiet storm is well performed but dull yet the prince-styled numbers are engaging melodic and nimble strong showcases for benet's mellow skills 1 mojo gave the album three out of five stars and called it a very palatable collection of self-penned confessional songs 2 laura checkoway of vibe called it an uneven mix of simplistic sentimentality stating reflective and repentant at times hurricane is more likely to sing you to sleep than knock you off your feet 3 the washington post commented favorably on the album's themes of healing and redemption and stated the spiritual tone often brings out the best in eric benet]'s supple tenor on in the end and
