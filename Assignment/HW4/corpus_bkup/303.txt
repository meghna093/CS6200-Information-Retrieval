from other australian states the legislature has no upper house for a large portion of its history the state was under a gerrymander that heavily favoured rural electorates this combined with the already decentralised nature of queensland meant that politics has been dominated by regional interests queensland along with new south wales formerly operated a balloting system known as optional preferential voting for state elections this is different from the predominant australian electoral system the instant-runoff voting system and in practice is closer to a first past the post ballot similar to the ballot used in the uk which some say is to the detriment of minor parties the next queensland election will use instant-runoff voting these conditions have had notable practical ramifications for politics in queensland the lack of an upper house for substantial legislative review has meant that queensland has had a tradition of domination by strong-willed populist premiers often with arguably authoritarian tendencies holding office for long periods while most australian states have their populations heavily concentrated in the capital cities brisbane accounts for only about 45 percent of queensland's population the strong decentralisation of the population made the state a stronghold for the national party before the merger of the queensland branches of the liberals and nationals as the liberal national party the national party had been the senior partner in the non-labor coalition since 1924 in other states and federally the long-standing coalition between the nationals and liberals typically has the national party as the junior partner see also queensland portal crime and misconduct commission politics of queensland women in the queensland
