contrast to the group's previous effort pretty odd which debuted in 2008 with first-week sales of 139,000.[50 the album also came in second on billboard's alternative albums chart and fifth on the digital albums ranking 47 as of january 2016 it has sold 194,000 copies in the united states 51 reception vices  virtues has received mixed to positive reviews at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics the album has received an average score of 62 out of 100 which indicates generally favourable reviews based on 15 reviews 52 jarett wieselman of the new york post called the record one of 2011's best and most captivating albums  calling sarah smiles the stand-out and noting the wise change in tone to high-energy with the second track let's kill tonight 63 alternative press also welcomed the new version of panic at the disco perhaps smith and urie's biggest success on vices is their disinterest in simply recreating either of their previous albums instead choosing to meld the youthful exuberance of their debut with the restraint and maturity of 2008's pretty odd  wrote critic evan lucy the duo sound absolutely recharged likely a result of the lineup shuffling but also perhaps a realization that the 70s were a nice place to visit for a couple years but life in the 21st century is much more fun 54 he went on to praise the elfman-esque string arrangements creepy undertones and twinkling pianos on several tracks and enjoy the scaled-back  more personal tracks such as the calendar and memories 54 james montgomery of mtv news said of the album vices is at its very core a studio album one stuffed with ideas and instrumentation which not only positions panic as perhaps this generation's brian-wilsons-on-a-budget but serves as a solid starting point for wherever urie and smith choose to go from here  he complimented the new sound of the band it's not exactly new not exactly old but it's definitely something call it a fresh start a return to form a re-imaging of the past just don't call it pretty odd because that ship has sailed panic are back to their old tricks exclamation point and all and perhaps that was the secret ingredient all along 64 negative criticism for the album mostly came regarding the inexperienced lyrcism of urie william goodman of spin criticized urie's lyrics of the album the result is verbose and generic diary-entry romance but praised the musical experimentation remarking vices  virtues's saving grace though is the varied instrumentation  marimbas xylophones accordion synths and digital atmospherics 61 jody rosen of rolling stone concurred with goodman and also focused positive opinion upon the arrangements of the album recommending nearly witches and calling the album emo retropop commenting it's the closest emo has come to the sound of old-school pop and rock with beach boys harmonies and even gypsy-style swing flavoring the usual hopped-up confessions 60 mikael wood of entertainment weekly agreed with these sentiments recommending the ballad of mona-lisa and the harmony-drenched sarah smiles 56 vices  virtues tour main article vices  virtues tour in support of

the small stages they first played during their a fever you can't sweat out era joining them for the jaunt were to be their labelmates fun with foxy shazam and funeral party splitting duties as the third act on the bill 67 the tour sported the same electric over-the-top theatricality the band was known for during the fever era i really miss wearing costumes and makeup  urie told spin i love
