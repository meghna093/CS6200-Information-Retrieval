international space station resupply using the raffaello multi-purpose logistics module and the lightweight multi-purpose carrier lmc the failed ammonia pump module that was replaced in august 2010 returned inside atlantis payload bay this was the final mission of space shuttle atlantis and the last mission for the space shuttle program sts-135 flew with a crew of four astronauts the reduced crew size allowed for rescue by regularly scheduled soyuz missions if necessary 45 problems composite overwrapped pressure vessels nasa announced in 2007 that 24 helium and nitrogen gas tanks in atlantis were older than their designed lifetime these composite overwrapped pressure vessels copv were designed for a 10-year life and later cleared for an additional 10 years they exceeded this life in 2005 nasa said it could not guarantee any longer that the vessels on atlantis would not burst or explode under full pressure failure of these tanks could have damaged parts of the orbiter and even wound or kill ground personnel an in-flight failure of a pressure vessel could have even resulted in the loss of the orbiter and its crew nasa analyses originally assumed that the vessels would leak before they burst but new tests showed that they could in fact burst before leaking because the original vendor was no longer in business and a new manufacturer could not be qualified before 2010 when the shuttles were scheduled to be retired nasa decided to continue operations with the existing tanks therefore to reduce the risk of failure and the cumulative effects of load the vessels were maintained at 80 percent of the operating pressure as late in the launch countdown as possible and the launch pad was cleared of all but essential personnel when pressure was increased to 100 percent the new launch procedure was employed during some the remaining launches of atlantis 46 but was resolved when the two copvs deemed to have the highest risk of failure were replaced 47 window damage after the sts-125 mission a work light knob was discovered jammed in the space between one of atlantis's front interior windows and the orbiter dashboard structure the knob was believed to have entered the space during flight when the pressurized orbiter was expanded to its maximum size then once back on earth the orbiter contracted jamming the knob in place leaving as-is was considered unsafe for flight and some options for removal including window replacement would have included a 6-month delay of atlantis's next mission planned to be sts-129 had the removal of the knob been unsuccessful the worst-case scenario was that atlantis could have been retired from the fleet leaving discovery and endeavour to complete the manifest alone on 29 june 2009 atlantis was pressurized to 17 psi 120 kpa 3 psi above ambient which forced the orbiter to expand slightly the knob was then frozen with dry ice and successfully removed 48 small areas of damage to the window were discovered where the edges of the knob had been embedded into the pane 49 subsequent investigation of the window damage discovered a maximum defect depth of approximately 0.0003 in 7.6 m less than the reportable depth threshold of 0.0015 in 38 m and not serious enough to warrant the panes replacement 50 gallery liftoff of first flight of atlantis and the sts-51-j mission deployment of the magellan space probe

atlantis is shown in the 1986 film spacecamp the premise of the film involves a crew of students at united states space camp that are accidentally launched into space on-board atlantis atlantis is featured in the 1998 film deep impact as the spacecraft used to shuttle the crew to the fictional messiah spacecraft it is also featured in armageddon a film of the same year and with a similar plot in which the shuttle is destroyed in a meteor shower it is involved as well in the dig a 1995 science fiction adventure game in september 2014 soulvizion and division cm presented music video based on
