microburst  wikipediafor the networking phenomenon see micro-bursting networking tree damage from a downburst a microburst is a small downdraft that moves in a way opposite to a tornado microbursts are found in strong thunderstorms 1 there are two types of microbursts within a thunderstorm wet microbursts and dry microbursts they go through three stages in their cycle the downburst outburst and cushion stages a microburst can be particularly dangerous to aircraft especially during landing due to the wind shear caused by its gust front several fatal and historic crashes have been attributed to the phenomenon over the past several decades and flight crew training goes to great lengths on how to properly recover from a microburst wind shear event a microburst often has high winds that can knock over fully grown trees they usually last from a couple of seconds to several minutes history of term the term was defined by mesoscale meteorology expert ted fujita as affecting an area 4 km 2.5 mi in diameter or less distinguishing them as a type of downburst and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas 2 fujita also coined the term macroburst for downbursts larger than 4 km 2.5 mi 3 a distinction can be made between a wet microburst which consists of precipitation and a dry microburst which typically consists of virga 4 they generally are formed by precipitation-cooled air rushing to the surface but they perhaps also could be powered from the high speed winds of the jet stream deflected toward the surface by a thunderstorm or by dynamical processes see rear flank downdraft microbursts are recognized as capable of generating wind speeds higher than 75 m s 170 mph 270 km h microbursts have also been called air bombs 5 dry microbursts dry microburst schematic when rain falls below the cloud base or is mixed with dry air it begins to evaporate and this evaporation process cools the air the cool air descends and accelerates as it approaches the ground when the cool air approaches the ground it spreads out in all directions and this divergence of the wind is the signature of the microburst high winds spread out in this type of pattern showing little or no curvature are known as straight-line winds 6 dry microbursts produced by high based thunderstorms that generate little to no surface rainfall occur in environments characterized by a thermodynamic profile exhibiting an inverted-v at thermal and moisture profile as viewed on a skew-t log-p thermodynamic diagram wakimoto 1985 developed a conceptual model over the high plains of the united states of a dry microburst environment that comprised three important variables mid-level moisture a deep and dry adiabatic lapse rate in the sub-cloud layer and low surface relative humidity wet microbursts wet microburst schematic wet microbursts are downbursts accompanied by significant precipitation at the surface which are warmer   [21 on june 24 2010 shortly after 4:30 pm a wet microburst hit the city of charlottesville virginia field reports and damage assessments show that charlottesville experienced numerous downbursts during the storm with wind estimates at over 75 mph 121 km h in a matter of minutes trees and downed power lines littered the roadways a number of houses were hit by trees immediately after the storm up to 60,000 dominion power customers in charlottesville and surrounding albemarle county were without power 22 on june 11 2010 around 3:00 am a wet microburst hit a neighborhood in southwestern sioux falls south dakota it caused major damage to four homes all of which were occupied no injuries were reported roofs were blown off of garages and walls were flattened by the estimated 100 mph 160 km h winds the cost of repairs was thought to be 500,000 or more 23 on may 2 2009 the lightweight steel and mesh building in irving texas used for practice by the dallas cowboys football team was flattened by a microburst according to the national weather service 24 on march 12 2006 a microburst hit lawrence kansas 60 percent of the university of kansas campus buildings sustained some form of damage from the storm preliminary estimates put the cost of repairs at between 6 million and 7 million 25 see also convective storm detection downburst list of microbursts low level windshear alert system llwas planetary boundary layer pbl squall tornado vertical draft windthrow references notes bibliography fujita t t 1981 tornadoes and downbursts in the context of generalized planetary scales journal of the atmospheric sciences 38 8 wilson james w and roger m wakimoto 2001 the discovery of the downburst  tt fujita's contribution bulletin of the american meteorological society 82 1 external links the semi-official microburst handbook homepage noaa taming the microburst windshear nasa microbursts university of wyoming forecasting microbursts  downbursts forecast systems laboratory
