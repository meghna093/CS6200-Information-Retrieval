digital object identifier  wikipediafor the use of digital object identifiers on wikipedia see wikipedia digital object identifier digital object identifier acronym doi introduced 2000 2000 managing organisation international doi foundation example 10.1000 182 website doi org in computing a digital object identifier or doi is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify objects standardized by the international organization for standardization iso 1 an implementation of the handle system 2]       [28 an alternative to http proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for browsers thereby avoiding the conversion of the dois to urls 29 which depend on domain names and may be subject to change while still allowing the doi to be treated as a normal hyperlink for example the cnri handle extension for firefox enables the browser to access handle system handles or dois like hdl:4263537 4000 or doi:10.1000 1 directly in the firefox browser using the native handle system protocol this plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution a disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that at least at present most users will be encountering the dois in a browser mail reader or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed idf organizational structure the international doi foundation idf a non-profit organisation created in 1998 is the governance body of the doi system 30 it safeguards all intellectual property rights relating to the doi system manages common operational features and supports the development and promotion of the doi system the idf ensures that any improvements made to the doi system including creation maintenance registration resolution and policymaking of doi names are available to any doi registrant it also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the idf on users of the doi system the idf is controlled by a board elected by the members of the foundation with an appointed managing agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies the idf holds annual open meetings on the topics of doi and related issues registration agencies appointed by the idf provide services to doi registrants they allocate doi prefixes register doi names and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the doi system to cooperate with the idf in the development of the doi system as a whole and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community a list of current ras is maintained by the international doi foundation the idf is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the handle system by the dona foundation of which the idf is a board member and is responsible for assigning handle system prefixes under the top-level 10 prefix 31 registration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new doi name parts of these fees are used to support the idf the doi system overall through the idf operates on a not-for-profit cost recovery basis standardization the doi system is an international standard developed by the international organization for standardization in its technical committee on identification and description tc46 sc9.[32 the draft international standard iso dis 26324 information and documentation  digital object identifier system met the iso requirements for approval the relevant iso working group later submitted an edited version to iso for distribution as an fdis final draft international standard ballot 33 which was approved by 100 of those voting in a ballot closing on 15 november 2010.[34 the final standard was published on 23 april 2012.[1 doi is a registered uri under the info uri scheme specified by ietf rfc 4452 info doi is the infouri namespace of digital object identifiers 35 the doi syntax is a niso standard first standardised in 2000 ansi niso z39.84-2005 syntax for the digital object identifier 36 the maintainers of the doi system have deliberately not registered a doi namespace for urns stating that urn architecture assumes a dns-based resolution discovery service rds to find the service appropriate to the given urn scheme however no such widely deployed rds schemes currently exist doi is not registered as a urn namespace despite fulfilling all the functional requirements since urn registration appears to offer no advantage to the doi system it requires an additional layer of administration for defining doi as a urn namespace the string urn doi:10.1000 1 rather than the simpler doi:10.1000 1 and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution if rds mechanisms supporting urn specifications become widely available doi will be registered as a urn  international doi foundation factsheet doi system and internet identifier
