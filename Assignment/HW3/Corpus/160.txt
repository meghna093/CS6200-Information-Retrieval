thermal radiation  wikipediathis article is about any type of electromagnetic radiation from an object related to its temperature for infrared light see infrared heat radiation redirects here it is not to be confused with heat-ray disambiguation this article includes a list of references but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations october 2007 learn how and when to remove this template message thermal radiation in visible light can be seen on this hot metalwork its emission in the infrared is invisible to the human eye and the camera the image was taken with but an infrared camera could show it see thermography thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter all matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation when the temperature of a body is greater than absolute zero inter-atomic collisions cause the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules to change this results in charge-acceleration and or dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation and the wide spectrum of radiation reflects the wide spectrum of energies and accelerations that occur even at a single temperature examples of thermal radiation include the visible light and infrared light emitted by an incandescent light bulb the infrared radiation emitted by animals that is detectable with an infrared camera and the cosmic microwave background radiation thermal radiation is different from thermal convection and thermal conductiona person near a raging bonfire feels radiant heating from the fire even if the surrounding air is very cold sunlight is part of thermal radiation generated by the hot plasma of the sun the earth also emits thermal radiation but at a much lower intensity and different spectral distribution infrared rather than visible because it is cooler the earth's absorption of solar radiation followed by its outgoing thermal radiation have been held to be the two most important processes that determine the temperature and climate of the earth in most climate models however radiant-heat trapping by freely convective gases has never been demonstrated experimentally [12 therefore glass lets in radiation in the visible range allowing us to be able to see through it but does not let out radiation that is emitted from objects at or close to room temperature this traps what we feel as heat this is known as the greenhouse effect and can be observed by getting into a car that has been sitting in the sun[citation needed selective surfaces can also be used on solar collectors we can find out how much help a selective surface coating is by looking at the equilibrium temperature of a plate that is being heated through solar radiation if the plate is receiving a solar irradiation of 1350 w m minimum is 1325 w m on july 4 and maximum is 1418 w m on january 3 from the sun the temperature of the plate where the radiation leaving is equal to the radiation being received by the plate is 393 k 248 f if the plate has a selective surface with an emissivity of 0.9 and a cut off wavelength of 2.0 m the equilibrium temperature is approximately 1250 k 1790 f the calculations were made neglecting convective heat transfer and neglecting the solar irradiation absorbed in the clouds atmosphere for simplicity the theory is still the same for an actual problem to reduce the heat transfer from a surface such as a glass window a clear reflective film with a low emissivity coating can be placed on the interior of the surface low-emittance low-e coatings are microscopically thin virtually invisible metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the u-factor by suppressing radiative heat flow 13 by adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the window radiative power power emitted by a black body plotted against the temperature according to the stefanboltzmann law thermal radiation power of a black body per unit area of radiating surface per unit of solid angle and per unit frequency is given by planck's law as or in terms of wavelength where is a constant this formula mathematically follows from calculation of spectral distribution of energy in quantized electromagnetic field which is in complete thermal equilibrium with the radiating object the equation is derived as an infinite sum over all possible frequencies the energy of each photon is multiplied by the number of states available at that frequency and the probability that each of those states will be occupied integrating the above equation over the power output given by the stefanboltzmann law is obtained as where the constant of proportionality is the stefanboltzmann constant and is the radiating surface area the wavelength for which the emission intensity is highest is given by wien's displacement law as for surfaces which are not black bodies one has to consider the generally frequency dependent emissivity factor this factor has to be multiplied with the radiation spectrum formula before integration if it is taken as a constant the resulting formula for the power output can be written in a way that contains as a factor this type of theoretical model with frequency-independent emissivity lower than that of a perfect black body is often known as a grey body for frequency-dependent emissivity the solution for the integrated power depends on the functional form of the dependence though in general there is no simple expression for it practically speaking if the emissivity of the body is roughly constant around the peak emission wavelength the gray body model tends to work fairly well since the weight of the curve around the peak emission tends to dominate the integral constants definitions of constants used in the
