to the atlantic ocean a few miles further east many boats pass through this river to import and export virginia products history the native americans who populated the area east of the fall line in the late 16th and early 17th centuries called the james river the powhatan river named for the chief of the powhatan confederacy which extended over most of the tidewater region of virginia the english colonists named it james after king james i of england 4 as they also constructed the first permanent english settlement in the americas in 1607 at jamestown along the banks of the james river about 35 miles 56 km upstream from the chesapeake bay the navigable portion of the river was the major highway of the colony of virginia during its first 15 years facilitating supply ships delivering supplies and more people from england however for the first five years despite many hopes of gold and riches these ships sent little of monetary value back to the sponsors in 1612 businessman john rolfe successfully cultivated a non-native strain of tobacco which proved popular in england soon the river became the primary means of exporting the large hogsheads of this cash crop from an ever-growing number of plantations with wharfs along its banks this development made the proprietary efforts of the virginia company of london successful financially spurring even more development investments and immigration below the falls at richmond many james river plantations had their own wharfs and additional ports and or early railheads were located at warwick bermuda hundred city point claremont scotland and smithfield and during the 17th century the capital of the colony at jamestown navigation of the james river played an important role in early virginia commerce and the settlement of the interior although growth of the colony was primarily in the tidewater region during the first 75 years the upper reaches of the river above the head of navigation at the fall line were explored by fur trading parties sent by abraham wood during the late 17th century although ocean-going ships were unable to navigate beyond present-day richmond portage of products and navigation with smaller craft to transport crops other than tobacco was feasible produce from the piedmont and great valley regions traveled down the river to seaports at richmond and manchester through such port towns as lynchburg scottsville columbia and buchanan james river and kanawha canal the james river was considered as a route for transport of produce from the ohio valley the james river and kanawha canal was built for this purpose to provide a navigable portion of the kanawha river a tributary of the ohio river for the most mountainous section between the two points the james river and kanawha turnpike was built to provide a portage link via wagons and stagecoaches however before the canal could be fully completed in the mid-19th century railroads emerged as a more practical technology and eclipsed canals for economical transportation the chesapeake and ohio railway c&o was completed between richmond and the ohio river at the new city of huntington west virginia by 1873 dooming the canal's economic prospects in the 1880s the richmond and alleghany railroad was laid along the eastern portion of the canal's towpath and became part of the c&o within 10 years in modern times this rail line is used primarily in transporting west virginia coal to export coal piers at newport news recreation james river at huntington park beach in newport news the james river contains

the greatest reservoir capacity at 1,617 feet the longest dam is the cushaw hydroelectric project due to the highly angled path the dam takes across the river while not identified in the national inventory of dams a very low head weir structure is found below bosher dam in richmond on either side of williams island known as the z-dam for its zigzag course on the south side of the island the current structure was built in 1932 and serves to direct water into richmond's water treatment facility on the north bank the less than 5 feet tall dam does not serve any power or navigation purpose
