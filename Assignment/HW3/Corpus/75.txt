air pollution  wikipedia bad air quality and air quality redirect here for the obsolete medical theory see bad air for the measure of how polluted the air is see air quality index for the properties of air see qualities of air air pollution occurs when harmful substances including particulates and biological molecules are introduced into earth's atmosphere it may cause diseases allergies or death of humans it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops and may damage the natural or built environment human activity and natural processes can both generate air pollution indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 blacksmith institute world's worst polluted places report 1 according to the 2014 world health organization report air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide 2 an estimate roughly echoed by one from the international energy agency 3]                [clarification needed residents in public housing who are generally low-income and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical

from satellite 2002-2004 deaths from air pollution in 2004 air pollution is usually concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas especially in developing countries where environmental regulations are relatively lax or nonexistent 106 however even populated areas in developed countries attain unhealthy levels of pollution with los angeles and rome being two examples 107 between 2002 and 2011 the incidence of lung cancer in beijing near doubled while smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer in china the number of smokers is falling while lung cancer rates are rising 108 another project focusing on the effects on pollution in vegetation has been researched by the local university in sheffield uk national-scale air toxics assessments 19952005 the national-scale air toxics assessment nata is an evaluation of air toxics by the u s epa the epa has furnished four assessments that characterize nationwide chronic cancer risk estimates and noncancer hazards from inhaling air toxics the lates was from 2005 and made publicly available in early 2011 epa developed the nata as a state-of-the-science screening tool for state local tribal agencies to prioritize pollutants emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of the risks nata assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources but rather use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them nata provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing inhaling air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk this in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources including assessments of non-cancer health effects for diesel particulate matter assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged 109 most polluted cities by pm[110 particulate matter g m 2004 city 168 cairo egypt 150 delhi india 128 kolkata india calcutta 125 tianjin china 123 chongqing china 109 kanpur india 109

against which member states can set objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment and improve air quality where it is unsatisfactory 111 on 25 july 2008 in the case dieter janecek v freistaat bayern curia the european court of justice ruled that under this directive[111 citizens have the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values 112 this important case law appears to confirm the role of the ec as centralised regulator to european nation-states as regards air pollution control it places a supranational legal obligation on the uk to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen in 2010 the european commission ec threatened the uk with legal action against the successive breaching of pm10 limit values 113 the uk government has identified that if fines are imposed they could cost the nation upwards of 300 million per year 114 in march 2011 the greater london built-up area remains the only uk region in breach of the ec's limit values and has been given 3 months to implement an emergency action plan aimed at meeting the eu air quality directive 115 the city of london has dangerous levels of pm10 concentrations estimated to cause 3000 deaths per year within the city 116 as well as the threat of eu fines in 2010 it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western congestion charge zone which is claimed to have led to an increase in air pollution levels 117 in response to these charges boris johnson mayor of london has criticised the current need for european cities to communicate with europe through their nation state's central government arguing that in future a great city like london should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the european commission regarding its air quality action plan 115 this can be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions to air pollution using global governance networks for example through transnational relations transnational relations include but are not exclusive to national governments and intergovernmental organisations 118 allowing sub-national actors including cities and regions to partake in air pollution control as independent actors particularly promising at present are global city partnerships 119 these can be built into networks for example the c40 cities climate leadership group of which london is a member the c40 is a public non-state network of the world's leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions 119 the c40 has been identified as governance from the middle and is an alternative to intergovernmental policy 120 it has the potential to improve urban air quality as participating cities exchange information learn from best practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from national government decisions 119 a criticism of the c40 network is that its exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors see also air pollutant concentrations air
