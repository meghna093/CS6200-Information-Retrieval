cloud fog cold wave heat wave jet stream meteorology severe weather weather forecasting weather portal v t e weather is the state of the atmosphere describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold wet or dry calm or stormy clear or cloudy 1 most weather phenomena occur in the lowest level of the atmosphere the troposphere 2]          [42 in some areas people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and the wind chill forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead to survive through them modification the aspiration to control the weather is evident throughout human history from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the u s military operation popeye an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the north vietnamese monsoon the most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding they include the fog and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains and techniques to suppress hail 43 a recent example of weather control was china's preparation for the 2008 summer olympic games china shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of beijing in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 august 2008 guo hu head of the beijing municipal meteorological bureau bmb confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in baoding city of hebei province to the southwest and beijing's fangshan district recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters 44 whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques efficacy there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification 43 acid rain caused by industrial emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere adversely affects freshwater lakes vegetation and structures anthropogenic pollutants reduce air quality and visibility climate change caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air is expected to affect the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought extreme temperatures flooding high winds and severe storms 45 heat generated by large metropolitan areas have been shown to minutely affect nearby weather even at distances as far as 1,600 kilometres 990 mi 46 the effects of inadvertent weather modification may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization including ecosystems natural resources food and fiber production economic development and human health 47 microscale meteorology microscale meteorology is the study of short-lived atmospheric phenomena smaller than mesoscale about 1 km or less these two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as mesoscale and microscale meteorology mmm and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map these include small and generally fleeting cloud puffs and other small cloud features 48 extremes on earth early morning sunshine over bratislava slovakia february 2008 the same area just three hours later after light snowfall main articles extremes on earth and list of weather records on earth temperatures usually range 40 c 100 f to 40 f annually the range of climates and latitudes across the planet can offer extremes of temperature outside this range the coldest air temperature ever recorded on earth is 89.2 c 128.6 f at vostok station antarctica on 21 july 1983 the hottest air temperature ever recorded was 57.7 c 135.9 f at aziziya libya on 13 september 1922,[49 but that reading is queried the highest recorded average annual temperature was 34.4 c 93.9 f at dallol ethiopia 50 the coldest recorded average annual temperature was 55.1 c 67.2 f at vostok station antarctica 51 the coldest average annual temperature in a permanently inhabited location is at eureka nunavut in canada where the annual average temperature is 19.7 c 3.5 f 52 extraterrestrial within the solar system jupiter's great red spot in february 1979 photographed by the unmanned voyager 1 nasa space probe studying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on earth 53 weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on earth but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition the cassinihuygens mission to titan discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid methane and other organic compounds 54 earth's atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones three in each hemisphere 55 in contrast jupiter's banded appearance shows many such zones 56 titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude 57 and venus has a single jet near the equator 58 one of the most famous landmarks in the solar system jupiter's great red spot is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years 59 on other gas giants the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds gusts of up to 600 metres per second about 2,100 km h or 1,300 mph have been measured on the planet neptune 60 this has created a puzzle for planetary scientists the weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by neptune is only about 1900 of that received by earth yet the intensity of weather phenomena on neptune is far greater than on earth 61 the strongest planetary winds discovered so far are on the extrasolar planet hd 189733 b which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than 9,600 kilometres per hour 6,000 mph 62 space weather aurora borealis main article space weather weather is not limited to planetary bodies like all stars the sun's corona is constantly being lost to space creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the solar system the movement of mass ejected from the sun is known as the solar wind inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star such as coronal mass ejections form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems such as pressure and wind and is generally known as space weather coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the solar system as saturn 63 the activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces the interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae 64 and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals 65 see also weather station
