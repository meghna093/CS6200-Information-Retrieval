absorbed by a body or a thermodynamic system during a constant-temperature process  usually a first-order phase transition latent heat can be understood as heat energy in hidden form which is supplied or extracted to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature examples are latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization involved in phase changes i e a substance condensing or vaporizing at a specified temperature and pressure 1] [6 the term latent heat was introduced into calorimetry around 1750 when joseph black commissioned by producers of scotch whisky in search of ideal quantities of fuel and water for their distilling process 7 to studying system changes such as of volume and pressure when the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature in a thermal bath james prescott joule characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles i e a form of potential energy and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer 8 relating the latter to thermal energy specific latent heat a specific latent heat l expresses the amount of energy in the form of heat q required to completely effect a phase change of a unit of mass m usually 1kg of a substance as an intensive property intensive properties are material characteristics and are not dependent on the size or extent of the sample commonly quoted and tabulated in the literature are the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization for many substances from this definition the latent heat for a given mass of a substance is calculated by where table of specific latent heats the following table shows the specific latent heats and change of phase temperatures at standard pressure of some common fluids and gases citation needed specific latent heat for condensation of water  in clouds the specific latent heat of condensation of water in the temperature range from 25 c to 40 c is approximated by the following empirical cubic function where the temperature is taken to be the numerical value in c for sublimation and deposition from and into ice the specific latent heat is almost constant in the temperature range from 40 c to 0 c and can be approximated by the following empirical quadratic function variation with temperature or pressure as the temperature or pressure rises to the critical point the lhov falls to zero see also bowen ratio eddy covariance flux eddy correlation eddy flux sublimation physics specific heat capacity enthalpy of fusion enthalpy of vaporization references v t
