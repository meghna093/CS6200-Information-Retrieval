and watches 24 hours in advance despite the lack of early warning only six deaths ensued damage was greatest on kauai where the hurricane destroyed more than 1,400 houses and severely damaged more than 5,000 though not directly in the path of the eye oahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surge meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale the origin of iniki is unclear but it possibly began as a tropical wave that exited the african coast on august 18 it moved westward across the unfavorable atlantic ocean and crossed central america into the pacific on the august 28 the wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized conditions slowly became more favorable and as the convection concentrated around a center the wave was classified tropical depression eighteen-e on september 5 at this time the wave was located 1700 miles 2700 km southwest of cabo san lucas or 1550 miles 2500 km east-southeast of hilo 1 initially the thunderstorm activity was not concentrated towards the center and thus the depression was not expected to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength 2 the depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until september 8 when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm 1 located at the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central pacific it reached hurricane status on september 9 while 470 miles 760 km south-southeast of hilo the subtropical ridge which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the hawaiian islands weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed iniki to turn to the northwest with very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures iniki steadily intensified and attained major hurricane status on september 10 while south-southwest of the island chain 1 as iniki turned to the north it continued to strengthen reaching a peak of 145 mph 235 km h winds on september 11 while 170 miles 270 km south-southwest of poip on the island of kauai it continued rapidly to the north-northeast and made landfall on south-central kauai early on the 11th with sustained winds of 145 mph 235 km h making iniki a category 4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the national weather service reported wind gusts of up to 175 mph 280 km h the highest recorded wind speed from hurricane iniki was a 227 mph 365 km h reading [12 according to spielberg every single structure was in shambles roofs and walls were torn away telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see  spielberg included footage of iniki battering the kaua'i coastal walls as part of the completed film where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot members of the film's crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads 11 oahu upon passing by oahu iniki produced tides of 1.73 feet 0.50.9 m above normal 5 prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of oahu with the areas most affected being barbers point through kaena 1 the waianae coastline experienced the most damage with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments 13 in all hurricane iniki caused several million dollars in property damage 5 and two deaths on oahu 1 big island damage on the island of hawaii was minor seas of 10 ft 3.0 m were reported along with 40 mph 65 km h winds 14 in honokhau harbor three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk a beach near napoopoo on kealakekua bay lost some sand and to this day has never been the same 15 aftermath landfalling pacific major hurricanes intensity

hurricane their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days because iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed many kauai citizens insisted on paying in addition entertainers from all of hawaii including graham nash who owns a home on the north shore of kauai and the honolulu symphony provided free concerts to the victims 9 the film jurassic park was being filmed at the time the sets used for the deleted scene where mr arnold goes to the shed to turn the power on were destroyed the cast and crew took shelter in a hotel looting occurred in the aftermath of iniki though it was very minor a group of army corps of engineers who experienced the looting of hurricane andrew just weeks before were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane students returned to kauai public schools two weeks after the disaster kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help 9 the military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs though and help arrived before local officials requested aid 25 amateur radio proved to be extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm with volunteers coming from the neighboring islands as well as from around the pacific to assist in the recovery there was support of local government communications in lihue in the first week of recovery 13 as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the american red cross and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across kauai 26 in the months after the storm many insurance companies left hawaii to combat this state governor john d waihee iii enacted the hurricane relief fund in 1993 to help unprotected hawaii residents the fund was never needed for another hawaii hurricane and it was stopped in 2000 when insurance companies returned to the island 27 it is thought that hurricane iniki blew apart many chicken coops some possibly used to house fighting chickens this caused a dramatic increase in the numbers of wild chickens roaming kauai 28 the name iniki was retired due to this storm and was replaced with iolana within the central north pacific tropical storm list 29 less than three days after iniki struck hurricane orlene struck the big island as a depression see also tropical cyclones
