agency executive edward rappaport acting director parent agency noaa website www nhc noaa gov the national hurricane center nhc is the division of the united states national weather service responsible for tracking and predicting weather systems within the tropics between the prime meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern atlantic ocean the agency which is co-located with the miami branch of the national weather service is situated on the campus of florida international university in university park florida 1]  [40 the world meteorological organization continues to create and maintain the annual hurricane naming lists naming lists use a six-year rotation with the deadliest or most notable storm names retired from the rotation 41 the current acting director of the national hurricane center is edward rappaport following the retirement of richard knabb on may 15 2017 a permanent replacement director has not been announced 25 organization for the fiscal year of 2008 the budget for the nhc was 6.8 million 40 a total of 66 people work for the nhc with 12 of the staff composing their management 38 the nhc has been one of the nine national centers which compose the national centers for environmental prediction ncep 42 hurricane specialists unit the hsu operations area comprises four desks pictured from which the tropics are monitored known as the nhc from 1995 through 2010 the hurricane specialists within the hurricane specialists unit hsu are the chief meteorologists that predict the actions of tropical storms the specialists work rotating eight-hour shifts from may through november monitoring weather patterns in the atlantic and eastern pacific oceans whenever a tropical or subtropical cyclone forms they issue advisories every six hours until the storm is over public advisories are issued more often when the storm expected to be of tropical storm or hurricane intensity threatens land 43 the specialists coordinate with officials in each country likely to be affected they forecast and recommend watches and warnings 44 during the hurricane season the hsu routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season the hsu issues special tropical weather outlooks 45 backup responsibility for their northeast pacific area resides at the central pacific hurricane center cphc 46 and vice versa if cphc were to have communication issues 47 north atlantic responsibilities are backed up by the weather prediction center wpc 40 routine coordination occurs at 1700 utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future 48 outside of the hurricane season the specialists concentrate on public education efforts 49 hurricane specialists unit vacant lixion avila ph d jack beven

forecasting responsibility the tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb formerly the tropical satellite analysis and forecast unit and the tropical analysis center is a part of the national hurricane center and was created in 1967.[50 the tafb is responsible for high seas analyses and forecasts for tropical portions of the atlantic and pacific between the prime meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern atlantic ocean 51 unlike the hurricane specialists unit hsu tafb is staffed full-time around the year other responsibilities of the tafb include satellite-derived tropical cyclone position and intensity estimates wsr-88d radar fixes for tropical cyclones tropical cyclone forecast support media support and general operational support 52 the ocean prediction center backs up tafb in the event of a communications outage and vice versa 53 technology and science branch the technology  science branch tsb develops and transitions new tools and techniques into operations for tropical weather prediction in conjunction with other government and academic entities tsb created and continues development of the automated tropical cyclone forecasting atcf system used to incorporate various data and model outputs create and update hurdat and to generate tropical cyclone forecasts the tsb provides support for nhc computer and communications systems including its website tsb maintains a number of statistical and dynamical models used in predicting both tropical cyclone behavior and associated weather conditions the storm surge unit which develops and maintains software to forecast the storm surge of tropical cyclones is part of this branch 44 the techniques development and applications unit tdau is part of tsb 54 carcah the chief aerial reconnaissance coordination all hurricanes carcah is a subunit of the 53d weather reconnaissance squadron hurricane hunters carcah's mission is to provide a point-of-contact and to coordinate all tropical cyclone operational reconnaissance requirements at nhc and the central pacific hurricane center for the north atlantic caribbean gulf of mexico and the north pacific basin east of the international date line in accordance with the national hurricane operations plan nhop during the winter carcah coordinates the atlantic and pacific winter storm requirements in support of the national winter storms operations plan nwsop missions are flown in advance of the high-impact weather events forecast to affect the u s such as heavy snowfall 44 and at times when there is significant uncertainty within between numerical weather prediction output 55 hlt the hurricane liaison team hlt supports hurricane response through information exchange between the nhc the national weather service noaa nws and the emergency management community the hlt is composed of federal state and local emergency managers as well as nws meteorologists and hydrologists who maintain open lines of communication about the progress and threat level of the storm with appropriate federal state and local officials the team establishes and facilitates video and or teleconferences with the nhc fema and other federal agencies state emergency operations centers eocs weather prediction center hpc storm prediction center spc and river forecast centers rfcs 44 during significant landfalling hurricanes the president of the united states as well as affected city mayors and state governors join the daily briefing call which occurs at noon eastern daylight time 56 research as part of their annual tropical cyclone activity the agency issues a report on every tropical cyclone in the atlantic and eastern pacific ocean basins which are available since 1958 and 1988 respectively the report summarizes the synoptic history meteorological statistics casualties and damages and the post-analysis best track of a storm 57 the reports were formally known as preliminary reports up until 1999.[58 the agency maintains archives and climatological statistics on atlantic and pacific hurricane history including annual reports on every tropical cyclone a complete set of tropical cyclone advisories digitized copies of related materials on older storms season summaries published as the monthly weather review and hurdat which is the official tropical cyclone database 59 programs are dedicated to improving the accuracy of tropical cyclone forecasts from the center the joint hurricane testbed jht is a joint operation between the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and united states weather research program to speed up the transfer of tropical cyclone-related research into forecast operations since 2001 with its annual budget of between 1.0 and 1.5 million the jht has funded 62 initiatives with most of them being implemented operationally the projects have had varied success ranging from minor to significant advances in the way the nhc operates 60 the hurricane forecast improvement program's hfip five-year goal is to lead to a 20 percent improvement within the numerical weather prediction models provided by the national centers for environmental prediction to nhc by 2015 and a 50 percent improvement within tropical cyclone track forecasting and intensity guidance by 2020.[61 see also tropical cyclones
