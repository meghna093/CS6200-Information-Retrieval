latitude  wikipediathis article is about the geographical reference system for other uses see latitude disambiguation in geography latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the earth's surface latitude is an angle defined below which ranges from 0 at the equator to 90 north or south at the poles lines of constant latitude or parallels run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the earth without qualification the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude as defined in the following sections also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applications preliminaries two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude in the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses the second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface the simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid the definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface the latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the iso 19111 standard a since there are many different reference ellipsoids the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique this is stressed in the iso standard which states that without the full specification of the coordinate reference system coordinates that is latitude and longitude are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst this is of great importance in accurate applications such as a global positioning system gps but in common usage where high accuracy is not required the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated in english texts the latitude angle defined below is usually denoted by the greek lower-case letter phi  or  it is measured in degrees minutes and seconds or decimal degrees north or south of the equator the precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the earth either to set up theodolites or to determine gps satellite orbits the study of the figure of the earth together with its gravitational field is the science of geodesy this article relates to coordinate systems for the earth it may be extended to cover the moon planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature latitude on the sphere a perspective view of the earth showing how latitude  and longitude  are defined on a spherical model the graticule spacing is 10 degrees the graticule on the sphere the graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the earth the primary reference points are the poles where the axis of rotation of the earth intersects the reference surface planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the meridians and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through greenwich the prime meridian defines the longitude meridians are lines of constant longitude the plane through the centre of the earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the equator planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude these are the parallels the equator has a latitude of 0 the north pole has a latitude of 90 north written 90 n or 90 and the south pole has a latitude of 90 south written 90 s or 90 the latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point the normal to the surface of the sphere is along the radius vector the latitude as defined in this way for the sphere is often termed the spherical latitude to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article named latitudes on the earth the orientation of the earth at the december solstice besides the equator four other parallels are of significance the plane of the earth's orbit about the sun is called the ecliptic and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the earth is the equatorial plane the angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt the obliquity or the inclination of the ecliptic and it is conventionally denoted by i the latitude of the tropical circles is equal to i and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement 90  i the axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current epoch the time variation is discussed more fully in the article on axial tilt b the figure shows the geometry of a cross-section of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the earth and the sun at the december solstice when the sun is overhead at some point of the tropic of capricorn the south polar latitudes below the antarctic circle are in daylight whilst the north polar latitudes above the arctic circle are in night the situation is reversed at the june solstice when the sun is overhead at the tropic of cancer only at latitudes in between the two tropics is it possible for the sun to be directly overhead at the zenith on map projections there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear the examples below show the named parallels as red lines on the commonly used mercator projection and the transverse mercator projection on the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical both are complicated curves normal mercator transverse mercator  meridian distance on the sphere on the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude  is therefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned if the meridian distance is denoted by m  then where r denotes the mean radius of the earth r is equal to 6,371 km or 3,959 miles no higher accuracy is appropriate for r since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model with this value for r the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is 111.2 km or 69.1 miles the length of 1 minute of latitude is 1.853 km or 1.151 miles and this distance was formerly used as the basis of the nautical mile latitude on the ellipsoid ellipsoids in 1687 isaac newton published the philosophi naturalis principia mathematica in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid 1 this article uses the term ellipsoid in preference to the older term spheroid  newton's result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century see meridian arc  an oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis minor axis oblate ellipsoid of revolution is abbreviated to ellipsoid in the remainder of this article ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial  many different reference ellipsoids have been used in the history of geodesy in pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the geoid over the limited area of a survey but with the advent of gps it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids such as wgs84 with centre at the centre of mass of the earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the earth these geocentric ellipsoids are usually within 100 m 330 ft of the geoid since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another gps handsets include software to carry out datum transformations which link wgs84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid the geometry of the ellipsoid the shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the ellipse which is rotated about its minor shorter axis two parameters are required one is invariably the equatorial radius which is the semi-major axis a the other parameter is usually 1 the polar radius or semi-minor axis b or 2 the first flattening f or 3 the eccentricity e these parameters are not independent they are related by many other parameters see ellipse ellipsoid appear in the study of geodesy geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set a b f and e both f and e are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations they are of the order 1 300 and 0.08 respectively values for a number of ellipsoids are given in figure of the earth reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the inverse flattening 1 f for example the defining values for the wgs84 ellipsoid used

or any of the auxiliary latitudes defined on the reference ellipsoid constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional coordinate system on that ellipsoid to define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions three latitudes are used in this way the geodetic geocentric and reduced latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively geodetic coordinates geodetic coordinates p   h at an arbitrary point p consider the line pn which is normal to the reference ellipsoid the geodetic coordinates p   h are the latitude and longitude of the point n on the ellipsoid and the distance pn this height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location the direction of pn will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line the relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the earth spherical polar coordinates geocentric coordinate related to spherical polar coordinates p r   the geocentric latitude  is the complement of the polar angle  in conventional spherical polar coordinates in which the coordinates of a point are p r   where r is the distance of p from the centre o  is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and  is longitude since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points on the normal which all have the same geodetic latitude will have differing geocentric latitudes spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field ellipsoidal coordinates ellipsoidal coordinates p u   the reduced latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system for a point p not on the reference ellipsoid semi-axes oa and ob construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal same foci f f with the reference ellipsoid the necessary condition is that the product ae of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids let u be the semi-minor axis od of the auxiliary ellipsoid further let  be the reduced latitude of p on the auxiliary ellipsoid the set u   define the ellipsoid coordinates 3 4.2.2 these coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a uniform distribution of mass bounded by the reference ellipsoid coordinate conversions the relations between the above coordinate systems and also cartesian coordinates are not presented here the transformation between geodetic and cartesian coordinates may be found in geographic coordinate conversion the relation of cartesian and spherical polars is given in spherical coordinate system the relation of cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in torge 3 astronomical latitude astronomical latitude  is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true vertical at a point on the surface the true vertical the direction of a plumb line is also the direction of the gravity acceleration the resultant of the gravitational acceleration mass-based and the centrifugal acceleration at that latitude 3 astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the zenith and stars whose declination is accurately known in general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid the angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy 3][14 the reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is because the geoid is an idealized theoretical shape at mean sea level points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly also the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces which the theoretical geoid averages out astronomical latitude is not to be confused with declination the coordinate astronomers use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north south of the celestial equator see equatorial coordinates nor with ecliptic latitude the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north south of the ecliptic see ecliptic
