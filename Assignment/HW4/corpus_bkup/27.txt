simoom  wikipediathis article is about the desert wind for other uses see simoom disambiguation and simoun disambiguation simoom arabic  samm from the root    s-m-m  to poison is a strong dry dust-laden wind usually used to describe a local wind that blows in the sahara palestine jordan syria and the deserts of arabian peninsula its temperature may exceed 54 c 129 f and the humidity may fall below 10 alternative spellings include samoon samun simoun and simoon another name used for this wind is samiel persian samyeli simoom winds have an alternative type occurring in the region of central asia known as garmsil  the name means poison wind and is given because the sudden onset of simoom may also cause heat stroke this is attributed to the fact that the hot wind brings more heat to the body than can be disposed of by the evaporation of perspiration the nuttall encyclopdia described the simoom the storm moves in cyclone circular form carrying clouds of dust and sand and produces on humans and animals a suffocating effect 1 a 19th-century account of simoom in egypt reads egypt is also subject particularly during the spring and summer to the hot wind called the samoom  which is still more oppressive than the khamasin winds but of much shorter duration seldom lasting longer than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes it generally proceeds from the south-east or south-south-east and carries with it clouds of dust and sand 2 in north america it has been alleged that a simoom occurred on june 17 1859 in goleta and santa barbara california for example local historian walker tompkins wrote that during the morning the temperature hovered around the normal 24 to 27 c 75 to 81 f but around 1 p m strong super hot winds filled with dust began to blow from the direction of the santa ynez mountains to the north by 2 p m the temperature supposedly reached 56 c 133 f this temperature was said to have been recorded by an official u s coastal survey vessel that was operating in the waters just offshore in the santa barbara channel at 5 p m the temperature had reportedly dropped to 50 c 122 f and by 7 p m the temperature was back to a normal 25 c 77 f tompkins provided a supposed quote from a u s government report saying calves rabbits and cattle died on their feet fruit fell from trees to the ground scorched on the windward side all vegetable gardens were ruined a fisherman in a rowboat made it to the goleta sandspit with his face and arms blistered as if he had been exposed to a blast furnace 3 also according to tompkins local inhabitants were saved from the heat by seeking shelter in the thick adobe walled houses that were the standard construction at the time however experts contest this account ucsb professor joel michaelsen for instance said i have never found any outside source to validate tompkins story and i am highly skeptical of its veracity i don't doubt that strong hot dry downslope winds could kick up lots of dust and produce very high temperatures  but in the 110 f  115 f range at most the 133 f just isn't physically reasonable as it would require the creation of an extremely hot air mass somewhere to the northeast last monday's weather was a very good strong example of the sort of conditions that would produce such a heat wave and our temperatures topped out at least 20 degrees below tompkins figure stronger winds could have increased the heating a bit but not nearly that much add to all that meteorologically-based skepticism tompkins well-known tendency to mix liberal doses of fiction into his histories  and i think you have a strong case for discounting this one [4 meteorologist christopher c burt writing on weather underground says about the alleged incident there is no record of who made this measurement or exactly where it was made in santa barbara some later sources say it was made on a u s coastal geo-survey vessel if that is the case then the temperature is not possible since the waters off santa barbara in june are never warmer than about 70f and any wind blowing over the ocean would have its temperature modified by the cool water no matter how hot the air this report is singular and there is physical evidence burnt crops and dead animals that something amazing happened here this day but the temperature record is impossible to validate 5 figurative use of the word edgar allan poe's short story ms found in a bottle 1833 features a storm off the coast of java wherein every appearance warranted me the protagonist-narrator in apprehending a simoom  in the political essay chartism  thomas carlyle argues that even the poorest of men who have resigned themselves to misery and toil cannot resign themselves to injustice because they retain an innate sense that a higher divine justice must govern the world force itself the hopelessness of resistance has doubtless a composing effect against inanimate simooms and much other infliction of the like sort we have found it suffice to produce complete composure yet one would say a permanent injustice even from an infinite power would prove unendurable by men  walden 1854 by henry david thoreau references a simoom he uses it to describe his urge to escape something most unwanted there is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted it is human it is divine carrion if i knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good i should run for my life as from that dry and parching wind of the african deserts called the simoom which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated for fear that i should get some of his good done to mesome of its virus mingled with my blood noin this case i would rather suffer evil the natural way  in his 1854 novel hard times charles dickens in describing the oppressive midsummer heat of the sooty smoky factories of coketown writes the atmosphere of those fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom and their inhabitants wasting with heat toiled languidly in the desert book 2 chapter 1 in american notes dickens also describes that injurious political party spirit as the simoom of america sickening and blighting everything of wholesome life within its reach  p 93 in the 1913 chapman  hall ltd edition online from project gutenberg in bram stoker's novel dracula 1897 lucy describing the appearance of dracula in her room writes in her journal entry on september 17 that a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window and wheeling
