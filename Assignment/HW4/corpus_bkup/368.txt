northwest atlantic ocean breaking the record set by 1887 the season ran through the summer and the first half of fall in 1933 with activity as early as may and as late as november a tropical cyclone was active for all but 13 days from june 28 to october 7 the year was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones by the 2005 season which broke the record with 28 storms tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration may have remained undetected because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24 tropical cyclones 1 of the 20 storms during the season 11 attained hurricane status six of those were major hurricanes with sustained winds of over 111 mph 179 km h two of the hurricanes reached winds of 160 mph 260 km h which is a category 5the highest of 5 on the modern saffir-simpson hurricane scale nb 1 the season produced several deadly storms with eight storms killing more than 20 people all but 3 of the 20 known storms affected land at some point during their durations season summary the 1933 season was the most active of its time surpassing the previous record-holder of 19 storms in 1887 fifteen of the season's storms made landfall as tropical cyclones and another struck land as an extratropical storm eight tropical storms including six hurricanes hit the united states during the season including the chesapeakepotomac hurricane which the u s weather bureau described as one of the most severe in history along the mid-atlantic states seven tropical storms including four hurricanes hit mexico two of which caused severe damage in the tampico area 4 the season was continuously active with six storms forming during the month of august alone 5 at the time many storms received the distinction of being the earliest nth storm to form such as the earliest fifth tropical storm to form in a season most of the records were broken in later years 6 during the season the u s weather bureau issued storm and hurricane warnings for eight storms including coastal portions of texas as well as from florida to massachusetts forcing the evacuations of thousands of people the deadliest storm of the season was a hurricane that struck tampico mexico killing over 184 residents the costliest hurricane was the chesapeakepotomac hurricane which caused 27 million in damage from north carolina to new jersey nb 2 the hurricane produced rainfall that resulted in severe crop damage in maryland 4 in addition to the 20 tropical storms there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity the first developed on june 1 in the northwest caribbean and dissipated a few days later another depression developed on july 11 over panama and also quickly dissipated a tropical depression developed on july 17 in the northeastern atlantic west of the azores and one ship reported hurricane-force winds however there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized so it was not classified as a tropical storm originally there was a tropical storm in the database in the caribbean in the middle of august but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds similarly there was a tropical storm in the database in late september but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force winds 5 the season produced the highest accumulated cyclone energy ace on record with a total of 259 the measurement is a method to compare tropical cyclone activity between seasons originally 1933 had an ace of 213,         [nb 4 hurricane eighteen category 1 hurricane sshws duration october 25  november 7 peak intensity 90 mph 150 km h 1-min 982 mbar hpa after a two-week period of inactivity a tropical depression was detected in the western caribbean sea on october 25 it moved to the east-northeast then curved to the northwest while slowly intensifying on october 29 it strengthened into a hurricane near jamaica and reached peak winds of 90 mph 150 km h before striking the western portion of the island the hurricane turned to the northeast and weakened it made landfall on southeastern cuba as a strong tropical storm on october 31 the weakening storm changed its course to the north-northwest as it drifted through cuba and the bahamas on november 4 the storm turned once more to the northeast accelerated and was absorbed by an approaching cold front on november 7 near bermuda 5 while moving near western jamaica the hurricane produced strong winds of about 80 mph 130 km h 5 which wrecked about 90 of the banana crop 56 one plantation lost 500 banana trees and there was also damage to corn coffee and yams 57 many houses were wrecked or washed away 56 leaving hundreds homeless 57 the storm cut power and telegraph lines and blocked roads limiting communication 56 rail lines were cut and small bridges were washed away 58 damage was estimated at 3 million 56 and there were 23 deaths 57 the storm also produced strong winds and rainfall in cuba 58 tropical storm nineteen tropical storm sshws duration october 26  october 29 peak intensity 70 mph 110 km h 1-min 990 mbar hpa almost simultaneous to hurricane 19 a tropical storm developed a short distance east of the central bahamas on october 26 it moved north-northeastward then northeastward steadily strengthening along its path on october 27 a barometric pressure of 993 mbar 29.32 inhg was recorded within the storm and on october 28 the storm reached a peak intensity of 70 mph 110 km h on october 29 the storm became extratropical and turned north to hit nova scotia wedged between two high pressure systems it continued northward until dissipating over extreme eastern portions of quebec on october 30.[59 in atlantic canada the former tropical storm produced winds of 52 mph 83 km h in nova scotia along with heavy rainfall of 2.3 in 58 mm in amherst the storm sank one boat and washed another ashore winds were strong enough to knock down telephone and telegraph lines mainly due to fallen trees which also covered roads and damaged houses flooding washed out several bridges and roads covering one highway with 6 ft 1.8 m of water and entered the basements of houses in new brunswick the storm damaged or destroyed 72 bridges one man was struck by a car due to poor visibility from the storm 60 tropical storm twenty tropical storm sshws duration november 15  november 17 peak intensity 60 mph 95 km h 1-min 996 mbar hpa after another calm period the final tropical storm of the season was first observed on november 15 in the southwestern caribbean sea it moved slowly westward never strengthening beyond a minimal tropical storm in its short lifetime on november 16 it struck the southeastern coast of nicaragua and it dissipated soon after on november 17.[11 seasonal effects this is a table of the storms in 1933 and their landfall s in bold if any the minimum
