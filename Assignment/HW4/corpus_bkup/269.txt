weather radar  wikipedia weather wf44 radar dish university of oklahoma ou-prime c-band polarimetric weather radar during construction weather radar also called weather surveillance radar wsr and doppler weather radar is a type of radar used to locate precipitation calculate its motion and estimate its type rain snow hail etc  modern weather radars are mostly pulse-doppler radars capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to the intensity of the precipitation both types of data can be analyzed to determine the structure of storms and their potential to cause severe weather during world war ii radar operators discovered that weather was causing echoes on their screen masking potential enemy targets techniques were developed to filter them but scientists began to study the phenomenon soon after the war surplus radars were used to detect precipitation since then weather radar has evolved on its own and is now used by national weather services research departments in universities and in television newscasts raw images are routinely used and specialized software can take radar data to make short term forecasts of future positions and intensities of rain snow hail and other weather phenomena radar output is even incorporated into numerical weather prediction models to improve analyses and forecasts history david atlas during world war ii military radar operators noticed noise in returned echoes due to rain snow and sleet after the war military scientists returned to civilian life or continued in the armed forces and pursued their work in developing a use for those echoes in the united states david atlas 1 at first working for the air force and later for mit developed the first operational weather radars in canada j s marshall and r h douglas formed the stormy weather group                     [77 this is especially useful for meteorite recovery as weather radar are part of widespread networks and scan the atmosphere continuously furthermore the meteorites are cause a perturbance of local winds by turbulence which is noticeable on doppler outputs and are falling nearly vertically so their resting place on the ground is close to their radar signature an example is shown in the image on the right showing the park forest il meteorite fall which occurred on 26 march 2003 the red green feature at upper left is the motion of clouds near the radar itself and a signature of falling meteorites is seen inside the yellow ellipse at image center the intermixed red and green pixels indicate turbulence in this case arising from the wakes of falling high-velocity meteorites see also backscatter barber's pole lockheed wp-3d orion p-3 national hurricane research laboratory ou-prime notes references david atlas radar in
