weather portal v t e severe weather refers to any dangerous meteorological phenomena with the potential to cause damage serious social disruption or loss of human life 1 types of severe weather phenomena vary depending on the latitude altitude topography and atmospheric conditions high winds hail excessive precipitation and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather as are thunderstorms downbursts tornadoes waterspouts tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards snowstorms ice storms and duststorms 2 terminology meteorologists generally define severe weather as any aspect of the weather that poses risks to life property or requires the intervention of authorities a narrower definition of severe weather is any weather phenomena relating to severe thunderstorms 2]         [63 monsoons main article monsoon seasonal wind shifts lead to long-lasting wet seasons which produce the bulk of annual precipitation in areas such as southeast asia australia western africa eastern south america mexico and the philippines widespread flooding occurs if rainfall is excessive 64 which can lead to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas 65 floods cause rivers to exceed their capacity with nearby buildings becoming submerged 66 flooding may be exacerbated if there are fires during the previous dry season this may cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic and repel water 67 government organizations help their residents deal with wet-season floods though floodplain mapping and information on erosion control mapping is conducted to help determine areas that may be more prone to flooding 68 erosion control instructions are provided through outreach over the telephone or the internet 69 flood waters that occur during monsoon seasons can often host numerous protozoa bacterial and viral microorganisms 70 mosquitoes and flies will lay their eggs within the contaminated bodies of water these disease agents may cause infections of foodborne and waterborne diseases diseases associated with exposure to flood waters include malaria cholera typhoid hepatitis a and the common cold 71 possible trenchfoot infections may also occur when personnel are exposed for extended periods of time within flooded areas 72 tropical cyclone main article tropical cyclone the damage caused by hurricane andrew is a good example of the damage caused by a category 5 tropical cyclone a tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain a tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist air rises resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air tropical cyclones may produce torrential rain high waves and damaging storm surge 73 heavy rains produce significant inland flooding storm surges may produce extensive coastal flooding up to 40 kilometres 25 mi from the coastline although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they are also important factors in the precipitation regimes of areas they affect they bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions 74 areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage 75 tropical cyclones can also relieve drought conditions 76 they also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism as a result tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the earth's troposphere severe winter weather heavy snowfall main articles blizzard lake-effect snow snow and winter storm damage caused by lake storm aphid in october 2006 when extratropical cyclones deposit heavy wet snow with a snow-water equivalent swe ratio of between 6:1 and 12:1 and a weight in excess of 10 pounds per square foot 50 kg m2 [77 piles onto trees or electricity lines significant damage may occur on a scale usually associated with strong tropical cyclones 78 an avalanche can occur with a sudden thermal or mechanical impact on snow that has accumulated on a mountain which causes the snow to rush downhill suddenly preceding an avalanche is a phenomenon known as an avalanche wind caused by the approaching avalanche itself which adds to its destructive potential 79 large amounts of snow which accumulate on top of man-made structures can lead to structural failure 80 during snowmelt acidic precipitation which previously fell in the snow pack is released and harms marine life 81 lake-effect snow is produced in the winter in the shape of one or more elongated bands this occurs when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water providing energy and picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores 82 for more information on this effect see the main article conditions within blizzards often include large quantities of blowing snow and strong winds which may significantly reduce visibility reduced viability of personnel on foot may result in extended exposure to the blizzard and increase the chance of becoming lost the strong winds associated with blizzards create wind chill that can result in frostbites and hypothermia the strong winds present in blizzards are capable of damaging plants and may cause power outages frozen pipes and cut off fuel lines 83 strong extratropical cyclones main article extratropical cyclone the precipitation pattern of nor'easters is similar to other mature extratropical storms nor'easters can cause heavy rain or snow either within their comma-head precipitation pattern or along their trailing cold or stationary front nor'easters can occur at any time of the year but are mostly known for their presence in the winter season 84 severe european windstorms are often characterized by heavy precipitation as well 40 ice storm main article ice storm trees that have been destroyed by an ice storm ice storms are also known as a silver storm referring to the color of the freezing precipitation 85 ice storms are caused by liquid precipitation which freezes upon cold surfaces and leads to the gradual development of a thickening layer of ice 85 the accumulations of ice during the storm can be extremely destructive trees and vegetation can be destroyed and in turn may bring down power lines causing the loss of heat and communication lines 86 roofs of buildings and automobiles may be severely damaged gas pipes can become frozen or even damaged causing gas leaks avalanches may develop due to the extra weight of the ice present visibility can be reduced dramatically the aftermath of an ice storm may result in severe flooding due to sudden thawing with large quantities of displaced water especially near lakes rivers and bodies of water 87 heat and drought drought main article drought crops in australia that have failed due to drought conditions another form of severe weather is drought which is a prolonged period of persistently dry weather that is absence of precipitation 88 although droughts do not develop or progress as quickly as other forms of severe weather 89 their effects can be just as deadly in fact droughts are classified and measured based upon these effects 88 droughts have a variety of severe effects they can cause crops to fail 89 and they can severely deplete water resources sometimes interfering with human life 88 a drought in the 1930s known as the dust bowl affected 50 million acres of farmland in the central united states 88 in economic terms they can cost many billions of dollars a drought in the united states in 1988 caused over 40 billion in losses 90 exceeding the economic totals of hurricane andrew the great flood of 1993 and the 1989 loma prieta earthquake 89 in addition to the other severe effects the dry conditions caused by droughts also significantly increase the risk of wildfires 88 heat waves main article heat wave see also heat index a map indicating above-normal temperatures in europe in 2003 although official definitions vary a heat wave is generally defined as a prolonged period with excessive heat 91 although heat waves do not cause as much economic damage as other types of severe weather they are extremely dangerous to humans and animals according to the united states national weather service the average total number of heat-related fatalities each year is higher than the combined total fatalities for floods tornadoes lightning strikes and hurricanes 92 in australia heat waves cause more fatalities than any other type of severe weather 91 as in droughts plants can also be severely affected by heat waves which are often accompanied by dry conditions can cause plants to lose their moisture and die 93 heat waves are often more severe when combined with high humidity 92 see also storm chasing references
