international date line  wikipedia date line redirects here for other uses see dateline disambiguation the international date line idl is an imaginary line of navigation on the surface of the earth that runs from the north pole to the south pole and demarcates the change of one calendar day to the next it passes through the middle of the pacific ocean roughly following the 180 line of longitude but deviating to pass around some territories and island groups geography a simplified illustration of the relation between date line date and time of day each color represents a different date example depicting situation at 04:00 gmt tuesday times are approximate since time zone boundaries generally do not exactly coincide with meridians night and day is illustrative only daylight hours depend on latitude and time of year  description the idl is roughly based on the meridian of 180 longitude roughly down the middle of the pacific ocean and halfway around the world from the greenwich meridian in many places the idl follows the 180 meridian exactly in other places however the idl deviates east or west away from that meridian these various deviations generally accommodate the political and or economic affiliations of the affected areas proceeding from north to south the first deviation of the idl from 180 is to pass to the east of wrangel island and the chukchi peninsula the easternmost part of russian siberia wrangel island lies directly on the meridian at 7132n 1800e also noted as 7132n 1800w 1 it then passes through the bering strait between the diomede islands at a distance of 1.5 kilometres 0.93 mi from each island at 1685837 w 2 it then bends considerably west of 180 passing west of st lawrence island and st matthew island the idl crosses between the u s aleutian islands attu island being the westernmost and the commander islands which belong to russia it then bends southeast again to return to 180 thus all of russia is to the west of the idl and all of the united states is to the east except for the insular areas of guam the northern mariana islands and wake island the idl remains on the 180 meridian until passing the equator two us-owned uninhabited atolls howland island and baker island just north of the equator in the central pacific ocean and ships at sea between 172.5w and 180 have the latest time on earth utc12 hours the idl circumscribes kiribati by swinging far to the east almost reaching the 150w meridian kiribati's easternmost islands the southern line islands south of hawaii have the most advanced time on earth utc+14 hours south of kiribati the idl returns westwards but remains east of 180 passing between samoa and american samoa 3 in much of this area the idl follows the 165w meridian accordingly samoa tokelau wallis and futuna fiji tonga tuvalu and new zealand's kermadec islands and chatham islands are all west of the idl and have the same date american samoa the cook islands niue and french polynesia are east of the idl and one day behind the idl then bends southwest to return to 180 it follows that meridian until reaching antarctica which has multiple time zones conventionally the idl is not drawn into antarctica on most maps see  cartographic practice and convention below  circumnavigating the globe a person who goes around the world from east to west the same direction as magellan's voyage would gain or set their clock back one hour for every 15 of longitude crossed and would gain 24 hours for one circuit of the globe from east to west if they did not compensate by setting their clock forward one day when they crossed the idl in contrast a west-to-east circumnavigation of the globe loses an hour for every 15 of longitude crossed but gains back a day when crossing the idl the idl must therefore be observed in conjunction with the earth's time zones on crossing it in either direction the calendar date is adjusted by one day facts dependent on the idl for the two hours between 10:00 and 11:59 utc each day three different calendar dates are observed at the same time in different places on earth for example at 10:15 utc thursday it is 23:15 wednesday in american samoa utc11 thursday in most of the world and 00:15 friday in kiritimati utc+14 during the first hour utc 10:0010:59 all three calendar dates include inhabited places during the second hour utc 11:0011:59 one of the calendar dates is limited to an uninhabited maritime time zone twelve hours behind utc utc12 according to the clock the first areas to experience a new day and a new year are islands that use utc+14 these include portions of the republic of kiribati including millennium island in the line islands as well as samoa during the southern summer the first major cities to experience a new day are auckland and wellington new zealand utc+12 utc+13 with daylight saving time a 1995 realignment of the idl made caroline island one of the first points of land on earth to reach january 1 2000 on the calendar utc+14 as a result this atoll was renamed millennium island 4 the areas that are the first to see the daylight of a new day vary by the season around the june solstice the first area would be anyplace within the kamchatka time zone utc+12 that is far enough north to experience midnight sun on the given date at the equinoxes the first place to see daylight would be the uninhabited millennium island in kiribati which is the easternmost land located west of the idl near the december solstice the first places would be antarctic research stations using new zealand time utc+13 during summer that experience midnight sun these include amundsen-scott south pole station mcmurdo station scott base and mario zucchelli station 5 de facto and de jure date lines there are two ways time zones and thereby the location of the international date line are determined one on land and adjacent territorial waters and the other on open seas all nations unilaterally determine their standard time zones applicable only on land and adjacent territorial waters this date line can be called de facto since it is not based on international law but on national laws these national zones do not extend into international waters the nautical date line not the same as the idl is a de jure construction determined by international agreement it is the result of the 1917 anglo-french conference on time-keeping at sea which recommended that all ships both military and civilian adopt hourly standard time zones on the high seas the united states adopted its recommendation for u s military and merchant marine ships in 1920 this date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps it follows the 180 meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land forming gapsit is a pole-to-pole dashed line the 15 gore that is offset from utc by 12 hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5 gores that differ from utc by 12 hours ships are supposed to adopt the standard time of a country if they are within its territorial waters within 12 nautical miles 14 mi 22 km of land then revert to international time zones 15 wide pole-to-pole gores as soon as they leave in reality ships use these time zones only for radio communication and similar purposes for internal purposes such as work and meal hours ships use a time zone of their own choosing cartographic practice and convention the idl on the map on this page and all other maps is based on the de facto line and is an artificial construct of cartographers as the precise course of the line in international waters is arbitrary the idl does not extend into antarctica on the world time zone maps by the united states central intelligence agency cia     [29 cultural references and traditions the island of the day before the date line is a central factor in umberto eco's book the island of the day before 1994 in which the protagonist finds himself on a becalmed ship with an island close at hand on the other side of the idl unable to swim the protagonist indulges in increasingly confused speculation regarding the physical metaphysical and religious import of the date line around the world in eighty days the concept behind the idl though not the idl itself which did not yet exist appears as a plot device in jules verne's book around the world in eighty days 1873 the main protagonist phileas fogg travels eastward around the world he had bet with his friends that he could do it in 80 days to win the wager fogg must return by 8:45 pm on saturday 21 december 1872 however the journey suffers a series of delays and when fogg reaches london it's 8:50 pm on friday 20 december although he believes it's saturday 21 december and that he has lost the wager by a margin of only five minutes the next day however it is revealed that the day is saturday not sunday and fogg arrives at his club just in time to win the bet verne explains in journeying eastward he fogg had gone towards the sun and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth and these three hundred and sixty degrees multiplied by four minutes gives precisely twenty-four hoursthat is the day unconsciously gained in other words while phileas fogg going eastward saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times 35 fogg had thought it was one day more than it actually was because he had forgotten this simple fact during his journey he had added a full day to his clock at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees or four minutes per degree as verne writes at the time the concept of a de jure international date line did not exist if it did he would have been made aware that it would be a day less than it used to be once he reached this line thus the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line but a de facto date line did exist since the uk india and the us had the same calendar with different local times and he should have noticed when he arrived to the us that the local date was not the same as in his diary his servant jean passepartout kept his clock in london time despite the tips of his surroundings line-crossing ceremonies relating to the idl see also line-crossing ceremony ceremonies aboard ships to mark a sailor's or passenger's first crossing of the equator as well as crossing the international date line have been long-held traditions in navies and in other maritime services around the world mathematical description the need for a temporal discontinuity on the globe can be described mathematically as following from the borsuk-ulam theorem in dimension 1 it is a topological fact that there does not exist any continuous one-to-one
