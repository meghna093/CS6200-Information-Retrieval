17 fatalities meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale on july 6 a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa moving westward the disturbance gradually organized until july 10 at which point convection became more concentrated and it is estimated tropical depression five formed in the central tropical atlantic that evening 1 late on july 11 it strengthened and was named tropical storm emily initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the greater antilles emily instead moved almost due west toward the windward islands remaining a moderate tropical storm the storm languished while moving quickly west and struggled with maintaining its form contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind hurricane dennis had made portions of the caribbean sea warmer 2 and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development late on july 13 emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing tobago and entering the eastern caribbean on july 14 emily made landfall in northern grenada with 90 mph 145 km h winds 1 the intensification trend picked up again the next day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm's central pressure as it entered the southeastern caribbean sea a region typically unfavorable for intensification hurricane emily's winds increased in reaction briefly bringing the storm to category 4 strength early on july 15 during the day the storm's strength fluctuated greatly dropping to a category 2 storm and then rebuilding to category 4 on july 16 emily strengthened considerably making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form in the month of july with peak winds of 160 mph 260 km h the earliest known category 5 in the atlantic basin initially at this point emily was thought to have peaked as a category 4 storm but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a category 5 hurricane 1 the storm weakened slightly as it continued westward and remained a category 4 while passing south of jamaica and on july 17 the cayman islands hurricane emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest weakening somewhat but remaining at category 4 until striking cozumel just before mainland landfall at playa del carmen at 06:30 utc on july 18 sustained winds were 135 mph 215 km h and the eyewall passed directly over cozumel the center of circulation emerged over the gulf of mexico later that morning 1 passage over land disrupted the hurricane's center of circulation and it had weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75 mph 120 km h however several hours over the warm waters of the western gulf provided the energy needed for emily to regenerate and by midnight wind speeds were increasing the increase in wind speed stalled but the storm continued to become better organized emily started to show very symmetrical outflow but the hurricane's strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center however the outer wind radii subsided in the end and the inner core prevailed the result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core on the evening of july 19 the pressure dropped about 30 millibars and the winds went from 90 mph 145 km h to more than 125 mph 200 km h all within a few hours 1 further strengthening was expected by forecasters but did not come 1 the storm's motion slowed and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast the storm made landfall around 11:00 utc on july 20 near san fernando in tamaulipas the storm had sustained winds of 125 mph 200 km h category 3 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale after heading inland over northeast mexico it dissipated over the sierra madre oriental on july 21.
