when it was reestablished by seven constituent personnel under the leadership of edilberto parulan as officer-in-charge in 1946 pursuant to the tydings war damage act philippine rehabilitation act of 1946 a us weather bureau mission was sent to manila by the united states government to undertake a survey of the needs of the weather bureau as a result the bureau was able to acquire meteorological equipment and technical assistance from the united states that paved the way for the establishment of standard weather services patterned after similar meteorological institutions in more technically-advanced countries furthermore the weather bureau was transferred to the department of commerce and industry the bureau's functions were then carried out by five divisions synoptic climatological geophysical astronomical and administrative 2 in 1947 the central office of the weather bureau was moved to marsman building opposite pier 15 at the port area of manila while the forecasting center was transferred to the old balagbag terminal site of the first terminal of the manila international airport and became the manila main meteorological office mmmo the first post-war geophysical observatory of the bureau was established in 1949 behind the campus of the university of the philippines in diliman in 1948 a set of electromagnetic photorecording seismographs was installed in order to improve its seismological services on april 5 1949 the philippines was admitted into the world meteorological organization wmo with the weather bureau as its national meteorological service 2 in the same year temperature relative humility and pressure observations in the upper atmosphere were made twice daily by the laoag cebu and zamboanga field stations citation needed in 1950 a teletype service connected mmmo to clark air force base us naval station sangley point and the bureau of telecommunications precursor to the current national telecommunications commission philippines moreover exchange of weather reports with foreign countries aircraft-in-flight and four aeronautical stations in the country  laoag legazpi cebu  zamboanga began at this year private radio systems and the then national civil defense administration also helped to facilitate the reception of data and dissemination of the forecasts and warnings in 1954 radio transmissions of time signals which were done seven times daily began in the geophysical observatory which was now called astronomical observatory at this time 2 weather surveillance radar was first installed in the philippines in 1963 atop the central office of the bureau but this was destroyed beyond repair by a fire in 1978 in 1965 on its centenary half of the weather stations across the country were already linked with each other by single side-band radio transceivers forming an independent meteorological communication system in 1968 the philippines joined the typhoon committee formed by the economic commission for asia and the far east ecafe now economic and social commission for asia and the pacific or escap and the wmo 5 the following year saw the transfer of the central office from the marsman building to 1424 quezon boulevard extension in quezon city the same year also ushered the 5-year wmo training and research project manila composed of the institute of meteorology in the weather bureau and the department of meteorology in the university of the philippines the project aimed to meet the training needs of the country's meteorological personnel and to carry out research in various fields of meteorology the institute provided technical in-service training in various levels while the department offered a post-graduate course leading to a master of science degree in meteorology with the implementation of the project the acquisition of an ibm 1130 was realized and computerization in the bureau came of age a telemetry system in the marikina river basin was then set up which led to the bureau's initial efforts in flood forecasting 2 satellite meteorology came to the philippines in 1970 when an automatic picture transmission system was set-up to intercept phototransmission of the upper atmosphere by weather satellites the first post-war major research initiative of the bureau was launched in the same year called the typhoon research project it was launched in 1970 was made possible through the financial assistance of the national science development board in 1971 upon invitation of the philippines the ecafe wmo joint unit was reallocated in manila and was rechristened as the typhoon committee secretariat in the same year the linking of five weather surveillance radars installed across different parts of the country and the manila radar station it was not yet destroyed until 1978 paved the way for the weather radar surveillance network of the bureau 2 marcos era from weather bureau to pagasa in 1972 at the height of martial law of president ferdinand e marcos the weather bureau was abolished and a new agency the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa was established pursuant to the atmospheric geophysical and astronomical science act of 1972 presidential decree no 78 s 1972 as part of the integrated reorganization plan presidential decree no 1 s 1972 of the philippine government this new agency was placed under the authority of the department of national defense dnd 6 four organization units initially comprised pagasa the national weather service undertakes the preparation and subsequent prompt issuance of forecasts and warnings of weather and flood conditions the national atmospheric geophysical and astronomical data service undertakes the acquisition collection quality control processing and archiving of atmospheric and allied data the national geophysical and astronomical service undertakes observations and studies of seismological and astronomical phenomena as well as provides the official time for the country the national institute of atmospheric geophysical and astronomical sciences is responsible for the training of scientists and technical personnel with respect to atmospheric geophysical and astronomical sciences in 1977 the typhoon moderation research and development office and the national flood forecasting office were placed under administrative supervision of pagasa pursuant to presidential decree no 1149 s 1977.[7 pagasa saw a lot of accomplishments during the marcos era in 1973 the pampanga river basin flood forecasting and warning project a joint undertaking of the pagasa and the ministry of public works transportation and communications was inaugurated and upon recommendations of a survey mission the japanese government provided the equipment and training of personnel for the project early in 1974 pagasa in cooperation with the office of civil defense put up a radio station with callsign dzca through a network of automatic stations situated at strategic points along the pampanga river and its major tributaries data on the rise and fall of the river levels are sent to the flood forecasting center in the central office via existing telemetry system impressed with the success of the flood forecasting system in the pampanga river basin president marcos instructed pagasa to explore the possibility of putting up a similar system in the agno bicol and cagayan river basins the unesco-sponsored regional seismological network in southeast asia set up an office in the pagasa geophysical observatory in 1974 it sought to standardize the training of personnel and seismological equipment as well as to improve the accuracy of determining the epicenters of earthquakes in the region subsequently in 1977 a strong motion accelerograph network was put up in metro manila the network was designed to record strong earthquake vibrations in the area on april 18 1979 the science garden planetarium was opened to the public equipped with a minolta planetarium projector it has a seating capacity of 90 people in june 1981 the bicol flood forecasting sub-system based on the pampanga river system was inaugurated in may of the following year all three sub-systems agno bicol and cagayan became fully operational on the same occasion the ground receiving station for the geostationary meteorological satellite was inaugurated bringing the satellite meteorology of the philippines to a giant leap forward in april 1983 flood forecasting and warning system for dam operations was jointly undertaken by pagasa national power corporation and national irrigation administration with financial assistance in the form of loans from the japanese government phase 1 of the project covered angat and pantabangan dams while phase ii covered the magat binga and ambuklao dams as well as the data information center for the project the subsequent efforts of the government to centrally direct the integration of all government scientific and technological efforts led to the transfer of pagasa to the national science and technology authority through executive order no 984 s 1984.[8 the reorganization also transferred the seismological services of pagasa to the philippine institute of volcanology phivolc now philippine institute of volcanology and seismology phivolcs 9 post-1986 pagasa today following the reestablishment of the democratic government after the ouster of ferdinand marcos see people power revolution in 1986 president corazon c aquino ordered the reorganization of the national science and technology authority now called department of science and technology and all agencies under its authority pursuant to executive order 128 s 1987[10 five major branches weather flood forecasting climatology  agrometeorology astronomical geophysical  space science and national disaster reduction and three support divisions administrative finance  management and engineering  maintenance now constitute pagasa this organizational structure remained until october 2008 when the agency went under a rationalization program pursuant to executive order 366 s 2004 issued by president gloria macapagal-arroyo 11 the rationalization program of the government was aimed at making the government focus its efforts on vital core functions and enhance effectiveness and efficiency of public service 2 on january 15 2003 pagasa transferred its central office from 1424 quezon avenue to its permanent headquarters at the science garden located along agham road in diliman quezon city meanwhile scientific and technical operations are currently being undertaken in its weather and flood forecasting center a facility located just in front of its current headquarters 2 on november 3 2015 republic act no 10692 or the pagasa modernization act of 2015 was signed into law by president benigno aquino iii the government will initially spend three billion pesos from the pagcor revenues with a three-year span for the modernization fund of the state weather bureau that includes the upgrading and acquisition of equipment new salary scheme for the employees manpower training for future weathercasters and the creation of pagasa data center among other plans 12 tropical cyclones main article typhoons in the philippines pagasa monitors tropical cyclone activity and issues warnings if they fall within the philippine area of responsibility or par this area is bound by an imaginary line drawn along the following coordinates tropical cyclone bulletins are issued by pagasa every six hours for all tropical cyclones within this area that have or are anticipated to make landfall within the philippines or twelve hours when cyclones are not affecting land as of may 20 2015 pagasa used to classify tropical cyclones into five categories tropical depression  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 30 to 60 km h tropical storm  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 61 to 88 km h severe tropical storm  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 89 to 117 km h typhoon  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of more than 118 km h super typhoon  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of more than 220 km h 14 tornadoes on august 27 2007 pagasa announced that it was putting up a tornado warning system days after several more powerful and destructive tornadoes damaged houses in central luzon on august 23 2007 a 2nd tornado destroyed 30 houses in 4 villages in san miguel bulacan the first having damaged 27 houses in san rafael on aug 8.[15 however as of present time the weather bureau has yet to provide such warnings climatology the climate of the philippines is discussed in detail on the climatology page of the pagasa website pagasa lists patterns of temperature humidity rainfall seasons and four climate types for the philippines climate types are type 1  two pronounced seasons dry from november to april wet rest of the year type 2  no dry season but with heavier rainfall from november to january type 3  seasons are not very pronounced relatively dry from november to april and wet during the rest of the year type 4  rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year criticism on august 6 2010 president benigno aquino iii announced the removal of prisco nilo as the administrator of pagasa pagasa was directly under department of science and technology dost undersecretary for research and development r&d graciano yumul 16 a special order from dost secretary mario montejo dated august 5 2010 designated yumul as the new pagasa administrator nilo was criticized for lack of modern equipment forecast inaccuracies slow voluntary response and the aftermath of typhoon ondoy in september 2009 and typhoon basyang in july 2010 doppler weather radar weather stations and other equipment pagasa installed its first doppler weather radar station in baler aurora and another in baguio the new weather radars can monitor the typhoon and its movements amount of rainfall either moderate or heavy and real-time atmospheric forecasts using a visual radar monitor an example was that of typhoon basyang in 2010 data are used for warnings such as rainfall through project noah since june 2012 location of doppler weather radar installations in the philippines as of 2014 black circles operational red circles not in operation due to structural damage green circles under construction blue circles proposed new radar locations pagasa has installed at least ten doppler weather radars in the country currently operational stations are as follows luzon basco in batanes currently under repair aparri cagayan baguio city subic zambales baler aurora tagaytay cavite quezon in palawan virac in catanduanes the country's most modern radar facility visayas mactan cebu iloilo guiuan eastern samar mindanao tampakan south cotabato hinatuan surigao del sur moreover the weather bureau is now constructing at least two more doppler weather radar stations in busuanga palawan and zamboanga city 17 it aims to have thirteen operational radar stations nationwide by the end of 2013.[18 before nilo's leave an automated rain gauge was also installed in a telecommunications cellsite in montalban rizal in cooperation with smart communications to monitor excess rainfall as a warning signal to avert the effects of flashfloods and landslides by using cellphones the weather bureau plans to adopt its swift transfer of data from ground forecasting stations to main headquarters utilizing its automated data acquisition system modeled after japan meteorological agency's amedas in the near future as a solution to forecast inaccuracy and their problems the japan international cooperation agency will provide modernization programs to enhance the services of pagasa include meteorology and flood forecasting and tornado warnings as precautionary measures seven new doppler weather radars placed in different locations are scheduled to operate in june 2011 in addition the weather bureau introduced its landslide early warning sensor lews recently invented by the university of the philippines to reduce landslide casualties in case of landslides using this new device the sensor picks out signals in the form of computer data to show soil and ground movements and is transferred to the ground station immediately in an event of a landslide and in order to launch forced evacuation pagasa hopes to install 10 sensors in five landslide prone areas by 2012 when it is tested and ready to bury on ground another innovation to flood alerts was the adoption of an automated weather station aws designed to monitor amounts of rainfall and flood levels in case of an incoming warning the aws can be controlled by a computer even it is unmanned and a siren to evacuate people for emergencies few of the aws units are installed in few points of the country and many more units will be installed to extend its coverage in 2011 taiwan donated fifteen weather stations to the philippines department of science and technology and it has been reported that the philippines weather bureau will also share information from the new weather stations with taiwan's central weather bureau helping expand the range of taiwan's weather forecasts 19 pagasa and the philippines department of science and technology work jointly in the implementation of weather
