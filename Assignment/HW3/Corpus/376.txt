radiocarbon dating  wikipediaradiocarbon dating also referred to as carbon dating or carbon-14 dating is a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon 14c a radioactive isotope of carbon the method was developed by willard libby in the late 1940s and soon became a standard tool for archaeologists libby received the nobel prize in chemistry for his work in 1960 the radiocarbon dating method is based on the fact that radiocarbon is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen the resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis animals then acquire 14c by eating the plants when the animal or plant dies it stops exchanging carbon with its environment and from that point onwards the amount of 14c it contains begins to decrease as the 14c undergoes radioactive decay measuring the amount of 14c in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died the older a sample is the less 14c there is to be detected and because the half-life of 14c the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed is about 5,730 years the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50,000 years ago although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples the idea behind radiocarbon dating is straightforward but years of work were required to develop the technique to the point where accurate dates could be obtained research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of 14c in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years the resulting data in the form of a calibration curve is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of 14c in different types of organisms fractionation and the varying levels of 14c throughout the biosphere reservoir effects additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s because the time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than the time it takes for its 14c to decay below detectable levels fossil fuels contain almost no 14c and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of 14c in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century conversely nuclear testing increased the amount of 14c in the atmosphere which attained a maximum in 1963 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began measurement of radiocarbon was originally done by beta-counting devices which counted the amount of beta radiation emitted by decaying 14c atoms in a sample more recently accelerator mass spectrometry has become the method of choice it counts all the 14c atoms in the sample and not just the few that happen to decay during the measurements it can therefore be used with much smaller samples as small as individual plant seeds and gives results much more quickly the development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeology in addition to permitting more accurate dating within archaeological sites than previous methods it allows comparison of dates of events across great distances histories of archaeology often refer to its impact as the radiocarbon revolution radiocarbon dating has allowed key transitions in prehistory to be dated such as the end of the last ice age and the beginning of the neolithic and bronze age in different regions background history in 1939 martin kamen and samuel ruben of the radiation laboratory at berkeley began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research they synthesized 14c using the laboratory's cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atom's half-life was far longer than had been previously thought 1 this was followed by a prediction by serge a korff then employed at the franklin institute in philadelphia that the interaction of slow neutrons with 14n in the upper atmosphere would create 14c 2]                              [86 based on an analysis of the writing style palaeographic estimates were made of the age of 21 of the scrolls and samples from most of these along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated were tested by two ams laboratories in the 1990s the results ranged in age from the early 4th century bc to the mid 4th century ad in many cases the scrolls were determined to be older than the palaeographically determined age the isaiah scroll was included in the testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2 confidence level because of the shape of the calibration curve at that point there is a 15 chance that it dates from 355295 bc and an 84 chance that it dates from 21045 bc subsequently these dates were criticized on the grounds that before the scrolls were tested they had been treated with modern castor oil in order to make the writing easier to read it was argued that failure to remove the castor oil sufficiently would have caused the dates to be too young multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing the criticism 85 impact soon after the publication of libby's 1949 paper in science universities around the world began establishing radiocarbon-dating laboratories and by the end of the 1950s there were more than 20 active 14c research laboratories it quickly became apparent that the principles of radiocarbon dating were valid despite certain discrepancies the causes of which then remained unknown 87 the development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeology  often described as the radiocarbon revolution 88 in the words of anthropologist r e taylor 14c data made a world prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local regional and continental boundaries it provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies e g of stone tools or pottery it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances the advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested these improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a 14c date was incorrect taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research for example from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology 89 the dating framework provided by radiocarbon led to a change in the prevailing view of how innovations spread through prehistoric europe researchers had previously thought that many ideas spread by diffusion through the continent or by invasions of peoples bringing new cultural ideas with them as radiocarbon dates began to prove these ideas wrong in many instances it became apparent that these innovations must sometimes have arisen locally this has been described as a second radiocarbon revolution and with regard to british prehistory archaeologist richard atkinson has characterized the impact of radiocarbon dating as radical therapy for the progressive disease of invasionism more broadly the success of radiocarbon dating stimulated interest in analytical and statistical approaches to archaeological data 89 taylor has also described the impact of ams and the ability to obtain accurate measurements from very small samples as ushering in a third radiocarbon revolution 90 occasionally radiocarbon dating techniques date an object of popular interest for example the shroud of turin a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of jesus christ after his crucifixion three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the shroud in 1988 the results pointed to 14th-century origins raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic 13 researchers have studied other radioactive isotopes created by cosmic rays to determine if they could also be used to assist in dating objects of archaeological interest such isotopes include 3he 10be 21ne 26al and 36cl with the development of ams in the 1980s it became possible to measure these isotopes precisely enough for them to be the basis of useful dating techniques which have been primarily applied to dating rocks 91 naturally occurring radioactive isotopes can also form the basis of dating methods as with potassiumargon dating argonargon dating and uranium series dating 92 other dating techniques of interest to archaeologists include thermoluminescence optically stimulated luminescence electron spin resonance and fission track dating as well as techniques that depend on annual bands or layers such as dendrochronology tephrochronology and varve chronology 93 in 2016 the development of radiocarbon dating was recognized as a national historic chemical landmark for its contributions to chemistry and society by the american chemical society 94 see also dating methodologies in archaeology notes references  a
