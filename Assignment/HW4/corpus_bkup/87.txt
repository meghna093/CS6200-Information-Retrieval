revolution trans-atlantic trade including colonialism and slavery became crucial for western europe for european countries with a direct access to the atlantic including britain france the netherlands portugal and spain 15001800 was a period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in eastern europe and asia colonialism evolved as part of the trans-atlantic trade but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs growth was more rapid in non-absolutist countries such as britain and the netherlands and more limited in absolutist monarchies such as portugal spain and france where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies 67 trans-atlantic trade also resulted in an increasing urbanization in european countries facing the atlantic urbanization grew from 8 in 1300 10.1 in 1500 to 24.5 in 1850 in other european countries from 10 in 1300 11.4 in 1500 to 17 in 1850 likewise gdp doubled in atlantic countries but rose by only 30 in the rest of europe by end of the 17th century the volume of the trans-atlantic trade had surpassed that of the mediterranean trade 67 see also list of notable crossings of the atlantic ocean economy the atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves 5 the atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields fish marine mammals seals and whales sand and gravel aggregates placer deposits polymetallic nodules and precious stones 68 gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through currently there is no cost-effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit 69 various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills marine debris and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea 5 fisheries the shelves of the atlantic hosts one of the world's richest fishing resources the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the scotian shelf georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the bay of fundy the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks 5 fisheries have however undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the atlantic fisheries in the eastern central and south-west atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value the rest of the atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks the third group continuously increasing trend since 1950 is only found in the indian ocean and western pacific 70 banks of the north-east atlantic in the north-east atlantic total catches decreased between the mid-1970s and the 1990s and reached 8.7 million tons in 2013 blue whiting reached a 2.4 million tons peak in 2004 but was down to 628,000 tons in 2013 recovery plans for cod sole and plaice have reduced mortality in these species arctic cod reached its lowest levels in the 1960s1980s but is now recovered arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished sand eel is overfished as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished limited data makes the state of redfishes and deep-water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing stocks of northern shrimp and norwegian lobster are in good condition in the north-east atlantic 21 of stocks are considered overfished 70 banks of the north-west atlantic in the north-west atlantic landings have decreased from 4.2 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013 during the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery including greenland halibut yellowtail flounder atlantic halibut haddock spiny dogfish while other stocks shown no such signs including cod witch flounder and redfish stocks of invertebrates in contrast remain at record levels of abundance 31 of stocks are overfished in the north-west atlantic 70 capture of atlantic north-west cod in million tons in 1497 john cabot became the first to explore mainland north america and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of atlantic cod off newfoundland referred to as newfoundland currency this discovery supplied mankind with some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock mackerel and lobster from the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of european and asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species it also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as redfish greenland halibut witch flounder and grenadiers overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but because this was occurring on international waters it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made in the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery the population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process including american plaice redfish and greenland halibut together with flounder and grenadier 71 in the eastern central atlantic small pelagic fishes constitute about 50 of landings with sardine reaching 0.61.0 million tons per year pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fishes or overfished with sardines south of cape bojador the notable exception almost half of stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels total catches have been fluctuating since the 1970s reaching 3.9 million tons in 2013 or slightly less than the peak production in 2010.[70 bahama banks in the western central atlantic catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 1.3 million tons in 2013 the most important species in the area gulf menhaden reached a million tons in the mid-1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished round sardinella was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished groupers and snappers are overfished and northern brown shrimp and american cupped oyster are considered fully fished approaching overfished 44 of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels 70 agulhas bank in the south-east atlantic catches have decreased from 3.3 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.3 million tons in 2013 horse mackerel and hake are the most important species together representing almost half of the landings off south africa and namibia deep-water hake and shallow-water cape hake have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of southern african pilchard and anchovy have improved to fully fished in 2013.[70 in the south-west atlantic a peak was reached in the mid-1980s and catches now fluctuate between 1.7 and 2.6 million tons the most important species the argentine shortfin squid which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value is considered fully fished to overfished another important species was the brazilian sardinella with a production of 100,000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished half the stocks in this area are being fished at unsustainable levels whiteheads round herring has not yet reached fully fished but cunene horse mackerel is overfished the sea snail perlemoen abalone is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished 70 see also ocean fisheries  atlantic ocean and fishing down the food web

southern brazil and eastern argentina oil pollution in the caribbean sea gulf of mexico lake maracaibo mediterranean sea and north sea and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the baltic sea north sea and mediterranean sea north atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature sst at tropical latitudes changes that can be attributed to either the natural atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo or to anthropogenic climate change 73 a 2005 report indicated that the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc slowed down by 30 between 1957 and 2004.[74 if the amo were responsible for sst variability the amoc would have increased in strength which is apparently not the case furthermore it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity 73 therefore these changes in sst must be caused by human activities 75 the ocean mixed layer plays an important role heat storage over seasonal and decadal time-scales whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and has a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer this heat uptake provides a time-lag for climate change but it also results in a thermal expansion of the oceans which contribute to sea-level rise 21st century global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sea-level rise five times greater than today whilst melting of glaciers including that of the greenland ice-sheet expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century will probably result in a sea-level rise of 36 m over a millennium 76 on 7 june 2006 florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles the biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone 77 marine debris which is also known as marine litter describes human-created waste floating in a body of water oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter see also environmental impact of shipping and shutdown of thermohaline circulation see also environment portal ecology portal geography portal weather portal list of countries and
