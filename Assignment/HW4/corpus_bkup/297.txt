in general were of a taller stature than the arawaks they were described as being stronger than the arawaks reportedly due to the emphasis placed on training for warfare their skin was of a brown hue and they were usually naked and it was very rare for their loins to be covered the women painted their skin with a red dye called roucou which they used to make fantastical decorations of many colours the eyes of the females were usually circled with black the men also painted their bodies and on occasion wore feathered headdresses jewellery through their lips and jewellery through their noses they wore the caracoli which was a necklace of small bones along with the teeth of defeated enemies from which a crescent shaped ornament was suspended the caracoli was worn to represent the courage of the wearer religion the caribs are believed to have been polytheists as the spanish began to colonise the caribbean area they wanted to convert the natives to catholicism 12 the religion practised by the caribs had elements similar to the ancestor worship of the tano they believed in an evil spirit called maybouya who had to be placated for an individual to avoid harm the chief function of their shamans called buyeis was to heal the sick with herbs and to cast spells piai which would keep maybouya at bay the buyeis were very important and underwent special training instead of becoming warriors as they were held to be the only people who could avert evil they were treated with great respect their ceremonies were accompanied with sacrifices as with the arawaks and other native americans the caribs smoked tobacco in the rituals of their religion social organization early carib culture was patriarchal women carried out the domestic duties of rearing young children processing and producing food and clothing and cultivating the land for farming including sowing and harvesting men carried out the tasks of hunting for food and protecting women and children from attack by other warring tribes in the 17th century europeans reported that the women with their children lived in separate houses from men a custom recorded among other south american tribes citation needed the women were highly revered and held substantial socio-political power 13 island carib society was reputedly more socially egalitarian than tano society although there were village chiefs and war leaders there were no large states or multi-tiered aristocracy the local self-government unit may have been the longhouse dwellings populated by men or women typically run by one or more chieftains reporting to an island council food the caribs ate almost the same foods as the tainos they did not farm very well so they relied less on maize and cassava but still knew how to grow them although they were not very good farmers the caribs were excellent fishermen and were not afraid of long voyages their diet consisted of lots of protein they ate manatees ducks iguanas and fish among other foods the caribs had many myths and beliefs about diet  they believed that eating pig would give one small beady eyes they also believed eating turtle meat made one stupid 14 in doing so they deprived themselves of the protein that was easily available in the west indies they also believed that eating crab before a voyage would bring storms the caribs seasoned their food with pepper but did not use salt couii and taumalin were pepper sauces taumalin was made from pepper lemon juice and the green meat of crab the caribs made ouicou a cassava beer with a strong alcoholic content and got very drunk on festivals and holidays although their diet was not quite so varied as that of the arawaks it was well balanced prepared in many different ways and served with different seasonings 14 music this
