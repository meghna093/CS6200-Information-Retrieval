effects of global warming  wikipediathis article is primarily about effects during the 21st century for longer-term effects see long-term effects of global warming see also effects of global warming on humans projected global warming in 2100 for a range of emission scenarios the effects of global warming are the environmental and social changes caused directly or indirectly by human emissions of greenhouse gases there is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and that human activities are the primary driver 1 many impacts of climate change have already been observed including glacier retreat 2 changes in the timing of seasonal events    :2224 the sres scenarios are baseline or reference scenarios which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit ghg emissions e g the unfccc's kyoto protocol and the cancn agreements 24 emissions projections of the sres scenarios are broadly comparable in range to the baseline emissions scenarios that have been developed by the scientific community 22] :2224 for 1 different scenarios make different assumptions of future social and economic development e g economic growth population level energy policies which in turn affects projections of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 23]:2224 the projected magnitude of warming by 2100 is closely related to the level of cumulative emissions over the 21st century i e total emissions between 20002100 30 the higher the cumulative emissions over this time period the greater the level of warming is projected to occur 30 2 reflects uncertainty in the response of the climate system to past and future ghg emissions which is measured by the climate sensitivity 23]:2224 higher estimates of climate sensitivity lead to greater projected warming while lower estimates of climate sensitivity lead to less projected warming 31 over the next several millennia projections suggest that global warming could be irreversible 32 even if emissions were drastically reduced global temperatures would remain close to their highest level for at least 1,000 years see the later section on irreversibilities 33]    :18 widespread increases in heavy precipitation have occurred even in places where total rain amounts have decreased with medium confidence see footnote 1 ipcc 2012  :24 projections suggest a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions 53 in other words regions which are dry at present will in general become even drier while regions that are currently wet will in general become even wetter 53 this projection does not apply to every locale and in some cases can be modified by local conditions 53 extreme weather see also extreme weather and tropical cyclone  global warming over most land areas since the 1950s it is very likely that there have been fewer or warmer cold days and nights 55 hot days and nights have also very likely become warmer or more frequent 55 human activities have very likely contributed to these trends 55 there may have been changes in other climate extremes e g floods droughts and tropical cyclones but these changes are more difficult to identify 55 projections suggest changes in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events 55 confidence in projections varies over time 55 some changes e g more frequent hot days will probably be evident in the near term while other near-term changes e g more intense droughts and tropical cyclones are more uncertain 55 future climate change will be associated with more very hot days and fewer very cold days 55 the frequency length and intensity of heat waves will very likely increase over most land areas 55 higher growth in anthropogenic ghg emissions will be associated with larger increases in the frequency and severity of temperature extremes 56 assuming high growth in ghg emissions ipcc scenario rcp8.5 presently dry regions may be affected by an increase in the risk of drought and reductions in soil moisture 57 over most of the mid-latitude land masses and wet tropical regions extreme precipitation events will very likely become more intense and frequent 55 at the global scale the frequency of tropical cyclones will probably decrease or be unchanged 58 global mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and precipitation rates will likely increase 58 changes in tropical cyclones will probably vary by region but these variations are uncertain 58 the impacts of extreme events on the environment and human society will vary some impacts will be beneficiale g fewer cold extremes will probably lead to fewer cold deaths 59 overall however impacts will probably be mostly negative 60] :4 the increase in ocean heat content is much larger than any other store of energy in the earths heat balance over the two periods 1961 to 2003 and 1993 to 2003 and accounts for more than 90 of the possible increase in heat content of the earth system during these periods 76 global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets and warming of the ocean surface leading to increased temperature stratification other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation acidification main article ocean acidification this map shows changes in the amount of aragonite dissolved in ocean surface waters between the 1880s and the most recent decade 20032012 77 historical modeling suggests that since the 1880s increased co2 has led to lower aragonite saturation levels less availability of minerals in the oceans around the world 77 the largest decreases in aragonite saturation have occurred in tropical waters 77 however decreases in cold areas may be of greater concern because colder waters typically have lower aragonite levels to begin with 77 about one-third of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity has already been taken up by the oceans 78 as carbon dioxide dissolves in sea water carbonic acid is formed which has the effect of acidifying the ocean measured as a change in ph the uptake of human carbon emissions since the year 1750 has led to an average decrease in ph of 0.1 units 79 projections using the sres emissions scenarios suggest a further reduction in average global surface ocean ph of between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st century the effects of ocean acidification on the marine biosphere have yet to be documented 79 laboratory experiments suggest beneficial effects for a few species with potentially highly detrimental effects for a substantial number of species 78 with medium confidence fischlin et al 2007   :6 using models it is possible to identify the human signal of global warming over both land and ocean areas 96]:6 projected impacts projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale 96]:9 it is however expected that future warming will follow a similar geographical pattern to that seen already with greatest warming over land and high northern latitudes and least over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic ocean 97 nearly all land areas will very likely warm more than the global average 98 the arctic africa small islands and asian megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by climate change 99 low-latitude less-developed areas are at most risk of experiencing negative impacts due to climate change 100 developed countries are also vulnerable to climate change 101 for example developed countries will be negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some extreme weather events such as heat waves 101 in all regions some people can be particularly at risk from climate change such as the poor young children and the elderly 99]   :48 projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas such as fewer deaths from cold exposure and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of malaria in africa benefits were projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures especially in developing countries with very high confidence confalonieri et al 2007  :393 concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change economic growth on its own however was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change future vulnerability to climate change will depend not only on the extent of social and economic change but also on how the benefits and costs of change are distributed in society 121 for example in the 19th century rapid urbanization in western europe lead to a plummeting in population health 121 other factors important in determining the health of populations include education the availability of health services and public-health infrastructure 59]:393 water resources see also water security precipitation during the 20th century and up through 2008 during global warming the noaa estimating an observed trend over that period of 1.87 global precipitation increase per century a number of climate-related trends have been observed that affect water resources these include changes in precipitation the crysosphere and surface waters e g changes in river flows 122 observed and projected impacts of climate change on freshwater systems and their management are mainly due to changes in temperature sea level and precipitation variability 123 sea level rise will extend areas of salinization of groundwater and estuaries resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas in an assessment of the scientific literature kundzewicz et al 2007  :407 :110 it has been argued that environmental degradation loss of access to resources e g water resources 127 and resulting human migration could become a source of political and even military conflict 128 factors other than climate change may however be more important in affecting conflict for example wilbanks et al 2007     :78 models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive 156]:792 using the a2 sres emissions scenario schneider et al 2007  :789 found that this effect led to additional warming by the years 20902100 relative to the 19902000 of 0.11.5 c this estimate was made with high confidence the climate projections made in the ipcc fourth assessment report summarized earlier of 1.16.4 c account for this feedback effect on the other hand with medium confidence schneider et al 2007  :789 commented that additional releases of ghgs were possible from permafrost peat lands wetlands and large stores of marine hydrates at high latitudes greenland and west antarctic ice sheets with medium confidence authors of ar4 :5 the amoc is equivalently known as the thermohaline circulation thc 141 potential impacts associated with moc changes include reduced warming or in the case of abrupt change absolute cooling of northern high-latitude areas near greenland and north-western europe an increased warming of southern hemisphere high-latitudes tropical drying as well as changes to marine ecosystems terrestrial vegetation oceanic co 2 uptake oceanic oxygen concentrations and shifts in fisheries 159 according to an assessment by the us climate change science program ccsp 2008b 158]:5 it is very likely greater than 90 probability based on expert judgement  :12 that the strength of the amoc will decrease over the course of the 21st century warming is still expected to occur over most of the european region downstream of the north atlantic current in response to increasing ghgs as well as over north america although it is very unlikely less than 10 probability based on expert judgement  :12 that the amoc will collapse in the 21st century the potential consequences of such a collapse could be severe 158]:5 irreversibilities commitment to radiative forcing emissions of ghgs are a potentially irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing in the future 160 the contribution of a ghg to radiative forcing depends on the gas's ability to trap infrared heat radiation the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere and the length of time the gas resides in the atmosphere 160 co 2 is the most important anthropogenic ghg 161 while more than half of the co 2 emitted is currently removed from the atmosphere within a century some fraction about 20 of emitted co 2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years 162 consequently co 2 emitted today is potentially an irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing over thousands of years this commitment may not be truly irreversible should techniques be developed to remove co 2 or other ghgs directly from the atmosphere or to block sunlight to induce cooling 32 techniques of this sort are referred to as geoengineering little is known about the effectiveness costs or potential side-effects of geoengineering options 163 some geoengineering options such as blocking sunlight would not prevent further ocean acidification 163 irreversible impacts human-induced climate change may lead to irreversible impacts on physical biological and social systems 164 there are a number of examples of climate change impacts that may be irreversible at least over the timescale of many human generations 165 these include the large-scale singularities described above  changes in carbon cycle feedbacks the melting of the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets and changes to the amoc 165 in biological systems the extinction of species would be an irreversible impact 165 in social systems unique cultures may be lost due to climate change 165 for example humans living on atoll islands face risks due to sea-level rise sea-surface warming and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events 166 benefits of global warming in some locations and industries global warming may increase productivity though the ipcc cautions that estimates agree on the size of the impact small relative to economic growth and 17 of the 20 impact estimates shown in figure 10-1 are negative losses accelerate with greater warming and estimates diverge 167 the identified benefits are listed below co2 fertilisation effect co2 is one of the substances which plants require to grow increasing its amount in the air contributes to improved agriculture in some high latitude regions 168 increased growing season in greenland 169 increased productivity of sour orange trees 170 increased vegetation activity in high northern latitudes 171 increased plankton biomass in the north pacific subtropical gyre 172 recent increase in forest growth 173 increased arctic tundra plant reproduction 174 human health winter deaths might decline as temperatures warm however this is disputed for at least some regions for example 175 states although excess winter deaths evidently do exist winter cold severity no longer predicts the numbers affected we conclude that no evidence exists that excess winter deaths in england and wales will fall if winters warm with climate change  ice-free northwest passage ships will travel on a shorter route between the pacific and atlantic oceans 176 animal population changes some animals will benefit from the warming increase in chinstrap and gentoo penguins 177 bigger marmots 178 scientific opinion the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has published several major assessments on the effects of global warming 179 its most recent comprehensive impact assessment was published in 2014.  :44 confidence levels used in the tar 192 very high  95 or greater high  6795 medium  3367 low  533 very low  5 or less confidence statements made in ar4 are

formulation probability is not only a function of an event but also the state of information that is available to the person making the assessment 195 in this framework assigned probabilities may change as more or different information becomes available 195 the ipcc also uses another scale to describe the likelihood of a particular event occurring 29 this is different from the confidence scales described above and it is possible to assign confidence values to statements of likelihood for example the judgement that an event is improbable e g rolling a dice twice and getting a six both times may be assigned a high level of scientific confidence 29 also the probability that an event has an even chance of occurring e g a tossed coin coming up heads may also be assigned a high level of confidence 29 notes references allison i et al 2009 the copenhagen diagnosis 2009 updating the world on the latest climate science sydney australia the university of new south wales climate change
