heat transfer coefficient  wikipediathe heat transfer coefficient or film coefficient or film effectiveness in thermodynamics and in mechanics is the proportionality constant between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat i e the temperature difference t the overall heat transfer by combined modes is usually expressed on terms of an overall conductance or overall heat transfer coefficient u heat transfer q ua t2-t1 where it is used in calculating the heat transfer typically by convection or phase transition between a fluid and a solid the heat transfer coefficient has si units in watts per squared meter kelvin w  m2k the heat transfer coefficient is the reciprocal of thermal insulance this is used for building materials r-value and for clothing insulation there are numerous methods for calculating the heat transfer coefficient in different heat transfer modes different fluids flow regimes and under different thermohydraulic conditions often it can be estimated by dividing the thermal conductivity of the convection fluid by a length scale the heat transfer coefficient is often calculated from the nusselt number a dimensionless number there are also online calculators available specifically for heat transfer fluid applications experimental assessment of the heat transfer coefficient poses some challenges especially when small fluxes are to be measured e g  1] [4 k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid l is the characteristic length with respect to the direction of gravity ral is the rayleigh number with respect to this length and pr is the prandtl number for laminar flows the following correlation is slightly more accurate it is observed that a transition from a laminar to a turbulent boundary occurs when ral exceeds around 109 external flow vertical cylinders for cylinders with their axes vertical the expressions for plane surfaces can be used provided the curvature effect is not too significant this represents the limit where boundary layer thickness is small relative to cylinder diameter the correlations for vertical plane walls can be used when where is the grashof number external flow horizontal plates w h mcadams suggested the following correlations for horizontal plates 5 the induced buoyancy will be different depending upon whether the hot surface is facing up or down for a hot surface facing up or a cold surface facing down for laminar flow and for turbulent flow for a hot surface facing down or a cold surface facing up for laminar flow the characteristic length is the ratio of the plate surface area to perimeter if the surface is inclined at an angle  with the vertical then the equations for a vertical plate by churchill and chu may be used for  up to 60 if the boundary layer flow is laminar the gravitational constant g is replaced with g cos when calculating the ra term external flow horizontal cylinder for cylinders of sufficient length and negligible end effects churchill and chu has the following correlation for external flow spheres for spheres t yuge has the following correlation for pr1 and 6 forced convection internal flow laminar flow sieder and tate has the following correlation for laminar flow in tubes where is the internal diameter is the fluid viscosity at the bulk mean temperature is the viscosity at the tube wall surface temperature 6 internal flow turbulent flow see also dittus-boelter equation the dittus-blter correlation 1930 is a common and particularly simple correlation useful for many applications this correlation is applicable when forced convection is the only mode of heat transfer i e there is no boiling condensation significant radiation etc the accuracy of this correlation is anticipated to be 15 for a fluid flowing in a straight circular pipe with a reynolds number between 10,000 and 120,000 in the turbulent pipe flow range when the fluid's prandtl number is between 0.7 and 120 for a location far from the pipe entrance more than 10 pipe diameters more than 50 diameters according to many authors[7 or other flow disturbances and when the pipe surface is hydraulically smooth the heat transfer coefficient between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface can be expressed explicitly as where the fluid properties necessary for the application of this equation are evaluated at the bulk temperature thus avoiding iteration forced convection external flow in analyzing the heat transfer associated with the flow past the exterior surface of a solid the situation is complicated by phenomena such as boundary layer separation various authors have correlated charts and graphs for different geometries and flow conditions for flow parallel to a plane surface where is the distance from the edge and is the height of the boundary layer a mean nusselt number can be calculated using the colburn analogy 6 thom correlation there exist simple fluid-specific correlations for heat transfer coefficient in boiling the thom correlation is for the flow of boiling water subcooled or saturated at pressures up to about 20 mpa under conditions where the nucleate boiling contribution predominates over forced convection this correlation is useful for rough estimation of expected temperature difference given the heat flux 9 where note that this empirical correlation is specific to the units given heat transfer coefficient of pipe wall the resistance to the flow of heat by the material of pipe wall can be expressed as a heat transfer coefficient of the pipe wall however one needs to select if the heat flux is based on the pipe inner or the outer diameter selecting to base the heat flux on the pipe inner diameter and assuming that the pipe wall thickness is small in comparison with the pipe inner diameter then the heat transfer coefficient for the pipe wall can be calculated as if the wall were not curved[citation needed where k is the effective thermal conductivity of the wall material and x is the wall thickness if the above assumption does not hold then the wall heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using the following expression where di and do are the inner and outer diameters of the pipe respectively the thermal conductivity of the tube material usually depends on temperature the mean thermal conductivity is often used combining heat transfer coefficients for two or more heat transfer processes acting in parallel heat transfer coefficients simply add for two or more heat transfer processes connected in series heat transfer coefficients add inversely 10 for example consider a pipe with a fluid flowing inside the approximate rate of heat transfer between the bulk of the fluid inside the pipe and the pipe external surface is 11 where overall heat transfer coefficient the overall heat transfer coefficient is a measure of the overall ability of a series of conductive and convective barriers to transfer heat it is commonly applied to the calculation of heat transfer in heat exchangers but can be applied equally well to other problems for the case of a heat exchanger can be used to determine the total heat transfer between the two streams in the heat exchanger by the following relationship where the overall heat transfer coefficient takes into account the individual heat transfer coefficients of each stream and the resistance of the pipe material it can be calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of a series of thermal resistances but more complex relationships exist for example when heat transfer takes place by different routes in parallel where the heat transfer coefficient is the heat transferred per unit area per kelvin thus area is included in the equation as it represents the area over which the transfer of heat takes place the areas for each flow will be different as they represent the contact area for each fluid side the thermal resistance due to the pipe wall is calculated by the following relationship where this represents the heat transfer by conduction in the pipe the thermal conductivity is a characteristic of the particular material values of thermal conductivities for various materials are listed in the list of thermal conductivities as mentioned earlier in the article the convection heat transfer coefficient for each stream depends on the type of fluid flow properties and temperature properties some typical heat transfer coefficients include air  h  10 to 100 w  m2k water  h  500 to 10,000 w  m2k thermal resistance due to fouling deposits often during their use heat exchangers collect a layer of fouling on the surface which in addition to potentially contaminating a stream reduces the effectiveness of heat exchangers in a fouled heat exchanger the buildup on the walls creates an additional layer of materials that heat must flow through due to this new layer there is additional resistance within the heat exchanger and thus the overall heat transfer coefficient of the exchanger is reduced the following relationship is used to solve for the heat transfer resistance with the additional fouling resistance 13 where this equation uses the overall heat transfer coefficient of an unfouled heat exchanger and the fouling resistance to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient of a fouled heat exchanger the equation takes into account that the perimeter of the heat exchanger is different on the hot and cold sides the perimeter used for the does not matter as long as it is the same the overall heat transfer coefficients will adjust to take into account that a different perimeter was used as the product will remain the same the fouling resistances can be calculated for a specific heat exchanger if the average thickness and thermal conductivity of the fouling are known the product of the average thickness and thermal conductivity will result in the fouling resistance on a specific side of the heat exchanger 13 where see
