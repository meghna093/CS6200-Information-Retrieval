stable release 1707 build 8326.2062  july 31 2017 3 months ago 2017-07-31   pp402404 since the late 1990s powerpoint's worldwide market share of presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent 12 powerpoint was originally designed to provide visuals for group presentations within business organizations but has come to be very widely used in many other communication situations both in business and beyond 13 the impact of this much wider use of powerpoint has been experienced as a powerful change throughout society 14 with strong reactions including advice that it should be used less 15 should be used differently 16 or should be used better 17 the first powerpoint version macintosh 1987 was used to produce overhead transparencies 18 the second macintosh 1988 windows 1990 could also produce color 35mm slides 18 the third version windows and macintosh 1992 introduced video output of virtual slideshows to digital projectors which would over time completely replace physical transparencies and slides 18 a dozen major versions since then have added many additional features and modes of operation  p51 to create a new application that would be especially suited to the new graphical personal computers such as microsoft windows and apple macintosh 23 gaskins produced his initial description of powerpoint about a month later august 14 1984 in the form of a 2-page document titled presentation graphics for overhead projection 24 by october 1984 gaskins had selected dennis austin to be the developer for powerpoint 25 gaskins and austin worked together on the definition and design of the new product for nearly a year and produced the first specification document dated august 21 1985.  p104 about six months later on may 1 1986 gaskins and austin chose a second developer to join the project thomas rudkin 22] p149 gaskins prepared two final product specification marketing documents in june 1986 these described a product for both macintosh and windows 29]  pp169171 a month later on february 22 1987 forethought announced powerpoint at the personal computer forum in phoenix john sculley the ceo of apple appeared at the announcement and said we see desktop presentation as potentially a bigger market for apple than desktop publishing 34 powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh shipped from manufacturing on april 20 1987 and the first production run of 10,000 units was sold out 35 acquisition by microsoft 19871992 by early 1987 microsoft was starting to plan a new application to create presentations an activity led by jeff raikes who was head of marketing for the applications division 36 microsoft assigned an internal group to write a specification and plan for a new presentation product 37 they contemplated an acquisition to speed up development and in early 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire dave winer's product called more an outlining program that could print its outlines as bullet charts 38 during this preparatory activity raikes discovered that a program specifically to make overhead presentations was already being developed by forethought inc and that it was nearly completed 36 raikes and others visited forethought on february 6 1987 for a confidential demonstration 22] p173 raikes later recounted his reaction to seeing powerpoint and his report about it to bill gates who was initially skeptical 36 i thought software to do overheadsthat's a great idea  i came back to see bill i said bill i think we really ought to do this  and bill said no no no no no that's just a feature of microsoft word just put it into word  and i kept saying bill no it's not just a feature of microsoft word it's a whole genre of how people do these presentations  and to his credit he listened to me and ultimately allowed me to go forward and buy this company in silicon valley called forethought for the product known as powerpoint when powerpoint was released by forethought its initial press was favorable the wall street journal reported on early reactions i see about one product a year i get this excited about  says amy wohl a consultant in bala cynwyd pa people will buy a macintosh just to get access to this product 39 on april 28 1987 a week after shipment a group of microsoft's senior executives spent another day at forethought to hear about initial powerpoint sales on macintosh and plans for windows 22] p191 the following day microsoft sent a letter to dave winer withdrawing its earlier letter of intent to acquire his company 40 and in mid-may 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire forethought 41 as requested in that letter of intent robert gaskins from forethought went to redmond for a one-on-one meeting with bill gates in early june 1987,  p197 and by the end of july an agreement was concluded for an acquisition the new york times reported 42 july 30 the microsoft corporation announced its first significant software acquisition today paying 14 million 29.5 million in present-day terms he acquisition of forethought is the first significant one for microsoft which is based in redmond wash forethought would remain in sunnyvale giving microsoft a silicon valley presence the unit will be headed by robert gaskins forethought's vice president of product development microsoft's president jon shirley offered microsoft's motivation for the acquisition we made this deal primarily because of our belief in desktop presentations as a product category forethought was first to market with a product in this category 44 microsoft set up within its applications division an independent graphics business unit to develop and to market powerpoint the first microsoft application group distant from the main redmond location 44 all the powerpoint people from forethought joined microsoft and the new location was headed by robert gaskins with dennis austin and thomas rudkin leading development 45 powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh was modified to indicate the new microsoft ownership and continued to be sold 45 a new powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh adding color 35mm slides appeared by mid-1988,   p403 powerpoint sold about 1 million copies in 1992 of which about 80 percent were for windows and about 20 percent for macintosh 65] p403 and in 1992 powerpoint's market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 63 percent 65] p404 by the last six months of 1992 powerpoint revenue was running at a rate of over 100 million annually 211 million in present-day terms  p405   p403 and in 1993 powerpoint's market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 78 percent 65] p404 in both years about half of total revenue came from sales outside the u s 65] p404 by 1997 powerpoint sales had doubled again to more than 4 million copies annually representing 85 percent of the world market 74 also in 1997 an internal publication from the powerpoint group said that by then over 20 million copies of powerpoint were in use and that total revenues from powerpoint over its first ten years 1987 to 1996 had already exceeded 1 billion 75 since the late 1990s powerpoint's market share of total world presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent by both industry and academic sources 76 operation the earliest version of powerpoint 1987 for macintosh could be used to print black and white pages to be photocopied onto sheets of transparent film for projection from overhead projectors and to print speaker's notes and audience handouts the next version 1988 for macintosh 1990 for windows was extended to also produce color 35mm slides by communicating a file over a modem to a genigraphics imaging center with slides returned by overnight delivery for projection from slide projectors powerpoint was used for planning and preparing a presentation but not for delivering it apart from previewing it on a computer screen or distributing printed paper copies 77 the operation of powerpoint changed substantially in its third version 1992 for windows and macintosh when powerpoint was extended to also deliver a presentation by producing direct video output to digital projectors or large monitors 77 in 1992 video projection of presentations was rare and expensive and practically unknown from a laptop computer robert gaskins one of the creators of powerpoint says he publicly demonstrated that use for the first time at a large microsoft meeting held in paris on february 25 1992 by using an unreleased development build of powerpoint 3.0 running on an early pre-production sample of a powerful new color laptop and feeding a professional auditorium video projector 78] pp373375 by about 2003 ten years later digital projection had become the dominant mode of use replacing transparencies and 35mm slides and their projectors 78] pp410414   pp7677 business people had for a long time made presentations for sales calls and for internal company communications and powerpoint produced the same formats in the same style and for the same purposes 95] p420 powerpoint use in business grew over its first five years 1987-1992 to sales of about 1 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 63 percent 96 over the following five years 1992-1997 powerpoint sales accelerated to a rate of about 4 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 85 percent 97 the increase in business use has been attributed to network effects  whereby additional users of powerpoint in a company or an industry increased its salience and value to other users 98 not everyone immediately approved of the greater use of powerpoint for presentations even in business ceos who very early were reported to discourage or ban powerpoint presentations at internal business meetings included lou gerstner at ibm in 1993 99 scott mcnealy at sun microsystems in 1996 100 and steve jobs at apple in 1997 101 but even so rich gold a scholar who studied corporate presentation use at xerox parc could write in 1999 within today's corporation if you want to communicate an idea you use powerpoint 102 uses beyond business at the same time that powerpoint was becoming dominant in business settings it was also being adopted for uses beyond business personal computing scaled up the production of presentations the result has been the rise of presentation culture in an information society nearly everyone presents 103 in 1998 at about the same time that gold was pronouncing powerpoint's ubiquity in business the influential bell labs engineer robert w lucky could already write about broader uses 104 the world has run amok with the giddy power of presentation graphics a new language is in the air and it is codified in powerpoint in a family discussion about what to do on a given evening for example i feel like pulling out my laptop and giving a vugraph presentation in church i am surprised that the preachers haven't caught on yet how have we gotten on so long without powerpoint over a decade or so beginning in the mid 1990s powerpoint began to be used in many communication situations well beyond its original business presentation uses to include teaching in schools    pp814 for such technical presentations and for most occasions apart from its initial domain of sales presentations tufte advised against using powerpoint at all in many situations according to tufte it would be better to substitute high-resolution graphics or concise prose documents as handouts for the audience to study and discuss providing a great deal more detail 15 many commentators enthusiastically joined in tufte's vivid criticism of powerpoint uses 132 and at a conference held in 2013 a decade after tufte's booklet appeared one paper claimed that despite all the criticism about his work tufte can be considered as the single most influential author in the discourse on powerpoint while his approach was not rigorous from a research perspective his articles received wide resonance with the public at large  133 there were also others who disagreed with tufte's assertion that the powerpoint program reduces the quality of presenters thoughts steven pinker professor of psychology at mit and later harvard had earlier argued that if anything powerpoint if used well would ideally reflect the way we think 134 pinker later reinforced this opinion any general opposition to powerpoint is just dumb it's like denouncing lecturesbefore there were awful powerpoint presentations there were awful scripted lectures unscripted lectures slide shows chalk talks and so on 135 much of the early commentary on all sides was informal and anecdotal because empirical research had been limited 136 use it differently see also richard e mayer and steve jobs keynotes a second reaction to powerpoint use was to say that powerpoint can be used well but only by substantially changing its style of use this reaction is exemplified by richard e mayer a professor of psychology at the university of california santa barbara who has studied cognition and learning particularly the design of educational multimedia and who has published more than 500 publications including over 30 books 137 mayer's theme has been that in light of the science it is up to us to make a fundamental shift in our thinkingwe can no longer expect people to struggle to try to adapt to our powerpoint habits instead we have to change our powerpoint habits to align with the way people learn 16 tufte had argued his judgment that the information density of text on powerpoint slides was too low perhaps only 40 words on a slide leading to over-simplified messages 138 mayer responded that his empirical research showed exactly the opposite that the amount of text on powerpoint slides was usually too high and that even fewer than 40 words on a slide resulted in powerpoint overload that impeded understanding during presentations 139 mayer suggested a few major changes from traditional powerpoint formats 16 replacing brief slide titles with longer headlines expressing complete ideas showing more slides but simpler ones removing almost all text including nearly all bullet lists reserving the text for the spoken narration using larger higher-quality and more important graphics and photographs removing all extraneous decoration backgrounds logos and identifications everything but the essential message mayer's ideas are claimed by carmine gallo to have been reflected in steve jobs's presentations mayer outlined fundamental principles of multimedia design based on what scientists know about cognitive functioning steve jobs's slides adhere to each of mayer's principles 140] p92 though not unique to jobs many people saw the style for the first time in jobs's famous product introductions 141 steve jobs would have been using apple's keynote which was designed for jobs's own slide shows beginning in 2003 but gallo says that speaking like jobs has little to do with the type of presentation software you use powerpoint keynote etc  all the techniques apply equally to powerpoint and keynote 140] pp14,46 gallo adds that microsoft's powerpoint has one big advantage over apple's keynote presentation softwareit's everywhere it's safe to say that the number of keynote presentations is miniscule in comparison with powerpoint although most presentation designers who are familiar with both formats prefer to work in the more elegant keynote system those same designers will tell you that the majority of their client work is done in powerpoint 140] p44 consistent with its association with steve jobs's keynotes a response to this style has been that it is particularly effective for ballroom-style presentations as often given in conference center ballrooms where a celebrated and practiced speaker addresses a large passive audience but less appropriate for conference room-style presentations which are often recurring internal business meetings for in-depth discussion with motivated counterparts 142 use it better see also stephen kosslyn a third reaction to powerpoint use was to conclude that the standard style is capable of being used well but that many small points need to be executed carefully to avoid impeding understanding this kind of analysis is particularly associated with stephen kosslyn a cognitive neuroscientist who specializes in the psychology of learning and visual communication and who has been head of the department of psychology at harvard has been director of stanford's center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences and has published some 300 papers and 14 books 143 kosslyn presented a set of psychological principles of human perception memory and comprehension that appears to capture the major points of agreement among researchers 144 he reports that his experiments support the idea that that it is not intuitive or obvious how to create effective powerpoint presentations that conform to those agreed principles and that even small differences that might not seem significant to a presenter can produce very different results in audiences understanding for this reason kosslyn says users need specific education to be able to identify best ways to avoid flaws and failures 144 specifically we hypothesized and found that the psychological principles are often violated in powerpoint slideshows across different fields that some types of presentation flaws are noticeable and annoying to audience members and that observers have difficulty identifying many violations in graphical displays in individual slides these studies converge in painting the following picture powerpoint presentations are commonly flawed some types of flaws are more common than others flaws are not isolated to one domain or context and although some types of flaws annoy the audience flaws at the level of slide design are not always obvious to an untrained observer the many flaws and failures identified were those likely to disrupt the comprehension or memory of the material  among the most common examples were bulleted items are not presented individually growing the list from the top to the bottom  more than four bulleted items appear in a single list  more than two lines are used per bulleted sentence  and words are not large enough i e greater than 20 point to be easily seen  among audience reactions common problems reported were speakers read word-for-word from notes or from the slides themselves  the slides contained too much material to absorb before the next slide was presented  and the main point was obscured by lots of irrelevant detail 144 kosslyn observes that these findings could help to explain why the many studies of instructional effectiveness of powerpoint have been inconclusive and conflicting if there were differences in the quality of the presentations tested in different studies that went unobserved because many may feel that good design is intuitively clear 144 in 2007 kosslyn wrote a book about powerpoint in which he suggested a very large number of fairly modest changes to powerpoint styles and gave advice on recommended ways of using powerpoint 17 in a later second book about powerpoint he suggested nearly 150 clarifying style changes in fewer than 150 pages 145 kosslyn summarizes 17] pp23,200 there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the powerpoint program as a medium rather i claim that the problem lies in how it is used in fact this medium is a remarkably versatile tool that can be extraordinarily effective for many purposes powerpoint presentations are a superior medium of communication which is why they have become standard in so many fields in 2017 an online poll of social media users in the uk was reported to show that powerpoint remains as popular with young tech-savvy users as it is with the baby boomers  with about four out of five saying that powerpoint was a great tool for making presentations  in part because powerpoint with its capacity to be highly visual bridges the wordy world of yesterday with the visual future of tomorrow 146 also in 2017 the managerial communication group of mit sloan school of management polled their incoming mba students finding that results underscore just how differently this generation communicates as compared with older workers 147 fewer than half of respondents reported doing any meaningful longer-form writing at work and even that minority mostly did so very infrequently but 85 percent of students named producing presentations as a meaningful part of their job responsibilities two-thirds report that they present on a daily or weekly basisso it's no surprise that in-person presentations is the top skill they hope to improve 147 one of the researchers concluded we're not likely to see future workplaces with long-form writing the trend is toward presentations and slides and we don't see any sign of that slowing down 147 u s military excess use of powerpoint by the u s military services began slowly because they were invested in mainframe computers ms-dos pcs and specialized military-specification graphic output devices all of which powerpoint did not support 148 but because of the strong military tradition of presenting briefings as soon as they acquired the computers needed to run it powerpoint became part of the u s military 149 by 2000 ten years after powerpoint for windows appeared it was already identified as an important feature of u s armed forces culture in a front-page story in the wall street journal 150 old-fashioned slide briefings designed to update generals on troop movements have been a staple of the military since world war ii but in only a few short years powerpoint has altered the landscape just as word processing made it easier to produce long meandering memos the spread of powerpoint has unleashed a blizzard of jazzy but often incoherent visuals instead of drawing up a dozen slides on a legal pad and running them over to the graphics department captains and colonels now can create hundreds of slides in a few hours without ever leaving their desks if the spirit moves them they can build in gunfire sound effects and images that explode like land mines powerpoint has become such an ingrained part of the defense culture that it has seeped into the military lexicon powerpoint ranger is a derogatory term for a desk-bound bureaucrat more adept at making slides than tossing grenades u s military use of powerpoint may have influenced its use by armed forces of other countries foreign armed services also are beginning to get in on the act you can't speak with the u s military without knowing powerpoint  says margaret hayes an instructor at national defense university in washington d c who teaches latin american military officers how to use the software 150 after another 10 years in 2010 and again on its front page the new york times reported that powerpoint use in the military was then a military tool that has spun out of control 151 like an insurgency powerpoint has crept into the daily lives of military commanders and reached the level of near obsession the amount of time expended on powerpoint the microsoft presentation program of computer-generated charts graphs and bullet points has made it a running joke in the pentagon and in iraq and afghanistan commanders say that behind all the powerpoint jokes are serious concerns that the program stifles discussion critical thinking and thoughtful decision-making not least it ties up junior officers in the daily preparation of slides be it for a joint staff meeting in washington or for a platoon leader's pre-mission combat briefing in a remote pocket of afghanistan the new york times account went on to say that as a result some u s generals had banned the use of powerpoint in their operations 151 powerpoint makes us stupid  gen james n mattis of the marine corps the joint forces commander said this month at a military conference in north carolina he spoke without powerpoint  brig gen h r mcmaster who banned powerpoint presentations when he led the successful effort to secure the northern iraqi city of tal afar in 2005 followed up at the same conference by likening powerpoint to an internal threat it's dangerous because it can create the illusion of understanding and the illusion of control  general mcmaster said in a telephone interview afterward some problems in the world are not bullet-izable  several incidents about the same time gave wide currency to discussions by serving military officers describing excessive powerpoint use and the organizational culture that encouraged it 152]       [268 in saving to older formats these versions of powerpoint will check to assure that no features have been introduced into the presentation which are incompatible with the older formats 254 powerpoint 2013 and 2016 will also save a presentation in many other file formats including pdf format mpeg-4 or wmv video as a sequence of single-picture files using image formats including gif jpeg png tiff and some older formats and as a single presentation file in which all slides are replaced with pictures powerpoint will both open and save files in opendocument presentation format odp for compatibility 247 see also google slides keynote presentation software libreoffice impress openoffice impress
