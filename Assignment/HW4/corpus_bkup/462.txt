surface combat vessels that conduct anti-air anti-missile warfare surface warfare anti-submarine warfare and strike operations independently or as members of a larger task force modern guided missile cruisers were developed out of a need to counter the anti-ship missile threat facing the united states navy this led to the development of the an spy-1 phased array radar and the standard missile with the aegis combat system coordinating the two ticonderoga-class cruisers were the first to be equipped with aegis and were put to use primarily as anti-air and anti-missile defense in a battle force

frigates are named after u s navy marine corps and coast guard heroes as of autumn 2015 the u s navy has retired its most recent class of frigates and expects that by 2020 the littoral combat ships lcs will assume many of the duties the frigate had with the fleet the lcs is a class of relatively small surface vessels intended for operations in the littoral zone close to shore it was envisioned to be a networked agile stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating anti-access and asymmetric threats in the littorals they have the capabilities of a small assault transport including a flight deck and hangar for housing two helicopters a stern ramp for operating small boats and the cargo volume and payload to deliver a small assault force with fighting vehicles to a roll-on roll-off port facility the ship is easy to reconfigure for different roles including anti-submarine warfare mine countermeasures anti-surface warfare intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance homeland defense
