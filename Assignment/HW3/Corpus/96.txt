nor'easter  wikipediafor other uses see nor'easter disambiguation a nor'easter also northeaster see below is a macro-scale cyclone the name derives from the direction of the strongest windsas an offshore air mass rotates counterclockwise winds tend to blow northeast-to-southwest over the region covered by the northwest quadrant of the cyclone use of the term in north america is associated with several different types of storms some of which can form in the north atlantic ocean and some of which form as far south as the gulf of mexico the term is most often used in the coastal areas of new england and the mid-atlantic states typically such storms originate as a low-pressure area that forms within 100 miles 160 km of the shore between north carolina and massachusetts the precipitation pattern is similar to that of other extratropical storms nor'easters are usually accompanied by very heavy rain or snow and can cause severe coastal flooding coastal erosion hurricane-force winds or blizzard conditions nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in new england and atlantic canada they thrive on converging air massesthe cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the waterand are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater 1]    [20 the nor'easters taking the east coast track usually indicates the presence of a high-pressure area in the vicinity of nova scotia 21 sometimes a nor'easter will move slightly inland and bring rain to the cities on the coastal plain new york city philadelphia baltimore etc  and snow in new england boston northward it can move slightly offshore bringing a wet snow south of boston to richmond virginia or even parts of the carolinas 22 such a storm will rapidly intensify tracking northward and following the topography of the east coast sometimes continuing to grow stronger during its entire existence a nor'easter usually reaches its peak intensity while off the canadian coast the storm then reaches arctic areas and can reach intensities equal to that of a weak hurricane it then meanders throughout the north atlantic and can last for several weeks 22 characteristics nor'easters are usually formed by an area of vorticity associated with an upper-level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low-pressure area to develop such storms are very often formed from the merging of several weaker storms a parent storm and a polar jet stream mixing with the tropical jet stream until the nor'easter passes thick dark low-level clouds often block out the sun temperatures usually fall significantly due to the presence of the cooler air from winds that typically come from a northeasterly direction during a single storm the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist all precipitation types can occur in a nor'easter high wind gusts which can reach hurricane strength are also associated with a nor'easter on very rare occasions such as in the north american blizzard of 2006 and a nor'easter in 1978 the center of the storm can take on the circular shape more typical of a hurricane and have a small dry slot near the center which can be mistaken for an eye although it is not an eye difference from tropical cyclones often people mistake nor'easters for tropical cyclones and do not differentiate between the two weather systems nor'easters differ from tropical cyclones in that nor'easters are cold-core low-pressure systems meaning that they thrive on cold air tropical cyclones are warm-core low-pressure systems which means they thrive on warm temperatures difference from other extratropical storms a nor'easter is formed in a strong extratropical cyclone usually experiencing bombogenesis while this formation occurs in many places around the world nor'easters are unique for their combination of northeast winds and moisture content of the swirling clouds nearly similar conditions sometimes occur during winter in the pacific northeast northern japan and northwards with winds from nw-n in europe similar weather systems with such severity are hardly possible the moisture content of the clouds is usually not high enough to cause flooding or heavy snow though ne winds can be strong geography the eastern united states from north carolina to maine and eastern canada can experience nor'easters though most often they affect the areas from northern new jersey northward the effects of a nor'easter sometimes bring high tides and strong winds as far south as coastal south carolina and georgia surfers wait in anticipation when a nor'easter is formed nor'easters cause a significant amount of beach erosion in these areas as well as flooding in the associated low-lying areas biologists at the woods hole oceanographic institution on cape cod have determined nor'easters are an environmental factor for red tides on the atlantic coast notable noreasters see also list of northeast snowfall impact scale winter storms and list of regional snowfall index category 5 winter storms here is a list of notable noreasters followed by a short description about the event the great blizzard of 1888  was one of the worst blizzards in u s history dropped 4050 inches of snow killed 400 people mostly in new york the great appalachian storm of november 1950  a very severe storm that dumped more than 30 inches of snow in many major metropolitan areas along the eastern united states record breaking temperatures and hurricane-force winds the storm killed 353 people the ash wednesday storm of 1962  caused severe tidal flooding and blizzard conditions from the mid-atlantic to new england killed 40 people the eastern canadian blizzard of march 1971  dropped over 32 inches of snow over areas of eastern canada killed at least 30 people the groundhog day gale of 1976  caused blizzard conditions for much of new england and eastern canada dropping a maximum of 56 inches of snow the northeastern united states blizzard of 1978  a catastrophic storm which dropped over 27 inches of snow in areas of new england kills a total of 100 people mainly people trapped in their cars on metropolitan boston's inner beltway and in rhode island the 1991 perfect storm the perfect storm  combined nor'easter hurricane  very unusual storm which evolved into a hurricane tidal surge caused severe damage to coastal areas especially massachusetts killed 13 people the december 1992 nor'easter the storm of the century 1993  a superstorm which affected the entire eastern u s

the north american blizzard of 2003  dropped over 2 feet of snow in several major cities including boston and new york city affected large areas of the northeastern and mid-atlantic u s and killed a total of 27 people white juan of 2004  a blizzard that affected atlantic canada crippling transportation in halifax nova scotia and dropping over 37 inches of snow in areas the north american blizzard of 2005  brought blizzard conditions to southern new england and dropped over 40 inches of snow in areas of massachusetts the north american blizzard of 2006  a powerful storm that developed a hurricane-like eye when off the coast of new jersey it brought over 30 inches of snow in some areas and killed 3 people the april 2007 nor'easter  an unusually late storm that dumped heavy snow in parts of northern new england and canada and heavy rains elsewhere the storm caused a total of 18 fatalities norida 2009  formed from the remants of hurricane ida produced moderate storm surge strong winds and very heavy rainfall throughout the mid-atlantic region it caused us 300 million 2009 in damage and killed six people the december 2010 north american blizzard  was a major blizzard which affected large metropolitan areas including new york city philadelphia providence and boston in some of these areas the storm brought up to 2 feet of snow in january 2011 two noreasters struck the east coast of the united states just two weeks apart and severely crippled new england and the mid-alantic during the first of the two storms a record of 40 inches was recorded in savoy massachusetts two people were killed the march 2010 nor'easter a slow-moving nor'easter that devastated the northeastern united states winds of up to 70 miles per hour snapped trees and power lines resulting in over 1 million homes and businesses left without electricity the storm produced over 10 inches of rain in new england causing widespread flooding of urban and low-lying areas the storm also caused extensive coastal flooding and beach erosion the 2011 halloween nor'easter  was a rare historic noreaster which produced record breaking snowfall for october in many areas of the northeastern u s especially new england the storm produced a maximum of 32 inches of snow in peru massachusetts and killed 39 people after the storm the rest of the winter for new england remained very quiet with much less than average snowfall and no other significant storms to strike the region for the rest of the season the november 2012 nor'easter  a moderately strong noreaster that is notable for striking the same regions that were impacted by hurricane sandy a week earlier the storm exacerbated the problems left behind by sandy knocking down trees that were weakened by sandy it also left several residents in the northeast without power again after their power was restored following hurricane sandy highest snowfall total from the storm was 13 inches recorded in clintonville connecticut the december 25th28th 2012 noreaster  a major noreaster that was notable for its tornado outbreak across the gulf coast states on christmas day as well as giving areas such as northeastern texas a white christmas the low underwent secondary cyclogenesis near the coast of north carolina and dumped a swath of heavy snow across northern new england and new york caused blizzard conditions across the ohio valley as well as an ice storm in the mountains of the virginias the february 2013 nor'easter  an extremely powerful and historic noreaster that dumped heavy snow and unleashed hurricane-force wind gusts across new england many areas received well over 2 feet of snow especially connecticut rhode island and eastern massachusetts the highest amount recorded was 40 inches in hamden connecticut and gorham maine received a record 35.5 inches over 700,000 people were left without power and travel in the region came to a complete standstill on the afternoon of february 9 when the storm was pulling away from the northeastern united states a well defined eye was seen in the center the eye feature was no longer there the next day and the storm quickly moved out to sea the nor'easter later moved on to impact the united kingdom before finally dissipating on february 20 the storm killed 18 people the march 2013 nor'easter  a large and powerful noreaster that ended up stalling along the eastern seaboard due to a blocking ridge of high pressure in newfoundland and pivoted back heavy snow and strong winds into the northeast united states for a period of 2 to 3 days many officials and residents were caught off guard as local weather stations predicted only a few inches of snow and a change over to mostly rain that forecast failed miserably as many areas received over a foot of snow with the highest amount being 29 inches in milton massachusetts several schools across the region particularly in the boston massachusetts metropolitan area remained in session during the height of the storm not knowing the severity of the situation rough surf and rip currents were felt all the way southwards towards florida's east coast the january 2015 nor'easter also known as the blizzard of 2015 by media outlets  unlike recent historical winter storms there was no indication that a storm of this magnitude was coming until about 3 days in advance the european computer model ecmwf first picked up on the potential for the nor'easter sometime before january 24 by the afternoon of january 24 most if not all major computer models were forecasting the storm to be much more severe than previously indicated earlier in the week on the same day the national weather service said they were aware about the potential for a major crippling snowstorm but decided to hold off on winter weather headlines due to still being in the middle of another nor'easter the blizzard began as an alberta clipper in the midwestern states which was forecast to transfer its energy to a new secondary low pressure off the coast of the mid atlantic and move northeastward and pass to the south and east of new england before the transition began most of the area was being affected by generally light snow on the morning and afternoon of january 26 it wasn't until the evening into the early morning hours of january 27 that the storm was forecast to begin rapid deepening stall and also do a loop it did stall for a time however the loop of the storm that was forecast did not happen due to this the storm began to slowly pull away to the northeast a little quicker than expected therefore the forecast for western portions of the area western connecticut and new york city miserably failed with the city and its suburbs only receiving generally 4 to 6 inches with a maximum of 9 inches recorded at central park further to the east the storm brought over 20 inches of snow to much of the area with several reports of over 30 inches across the state of massachusetts breaking many records a maximum of 36 inches was recorded in at least four towns across worcester county in massachusetts and the city of worcester itself received 34.5 inches marking the city's largest storm snowfall accumulation on record the city of boston recorded 24.6 inches making it the largest storm snowfall accumulation during the month of january and the city's sixth largest storm snowfall accumulation on record on the coast of massachusetts hurricane force gusts up to around 80 mph along with sustained winds between 50 and 55 mph at times were reported the storm also caused severe coastal flooding and storm surge the storm bottomed out to a central pressure of 970mb by january 28 the storm began to pull away from the area october 2015 north american storm complex  in early october a low pressure system formed in the atlantic tapping into moisture from hurricane joaquin the storm dumped a huge amount of rain mostly in south carolina january 2016 blizzard also known as winter storm jonas snowzilla or the blizzard of 2016 by media outlets  between january 23 and 24 a very severe nor'easter dumped 2 to 3 feet of snow in the east coast of the united states states of emergencies were declared in 12 states in advance of the storm as well as by the mayor of washington d c the blizzard also caused significant storm surge in new jersey and delaware that was equal to or worse than hurricane sandy sustained damaging winds over 50 mph were recorded in many coastal communities with a maximum gust to 85 mph on assateague island virginia a total of 55 people died due to the storm february 2017 blizzard also known as winter storm niko and the blizzard of 2017 by media outlets  forming as an alberta clipper in the northern united states on february 6 the system initially produced light snowfall from the midwest to the ohio valley as it tracked southeastwards it eventually reached the east coast of the united states on february 9 and began to rapidly grow into a powerful nor'easter dumping 1 to near 2 feet across the northeast megapolis the storm also produced prolific thunder and lightning across southern new england prior to the blizzard unprecedented and record-breaking warmth had enveloped the region with record highs of above 60 f 16 c recorded in several areas including central park in new york city some were caught off guard by the warmth and had little time to prepare for the snowstorm
