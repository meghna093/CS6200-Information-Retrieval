polar vortex  wikipedia the arctic polar vortex the typical polar vortex configuration in november 2013 a weak polar vortex on january 5 2014 a polar vortex is an upper level low-pressure area lying near the earth's pole there are two polar vortices in the earth's atmosphere which overlie the north and south poles each polar vortex is a persistent large-scale low pressure zone that rotates counter-clockwise at the north pole called a cyclone and clockwise at the south pole the bases of the two polar vortices are located in the middle and upper troposphere and extend into the stratosphere beneath that lies a large mass of cold dense arctic air the vortices weaken and strengthen from year to year when the vortex of the arctic is strong it is well defined there is a single vortex and the arctic air is well contained when weaker which it generally is it will break into two or more vortices when very weak the flow of arctic air becomes more disorganized and masses of cold arctic air can push equatorward bringing with it a rapid and sharp temperature drop the interface between the cold dry air mass of the pole and the warm moist air mass further south defines the location of the polar front the polar front is centered roughly at 60 latitude a polar vortex strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer due to its dependence on the temperature difference between the equator and the poles 1 the vortices span less than 1,000 kilometers 620 miles in diameter within which they rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and in a clockwise fashion in the southern hemisphere as with other cyclones their rotation is driven by the coriolis effect when the polar vortex is strong there is a single vortex with a jet stream that is well constrained near the polar front when the northern vortex weakens it separates into two or more vortices the strongest of which are near baffin island canada and the other over northeast siberia 2 the antarctic vortex of the southern hemisphere is a single low pressure zone that is found near the edge of the ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude when the polar vortex is strong the mid-latitude westerlies winds at the surface level between 30 and 60 latitude from the west increase in strength and are persistent when the polar vortex is weak high pressure zones of the mid latitudes may push poleward moving the polar vortex jet stream and polar front equatorward the jet stream is seen to buckle and deviate south this rapidly brings cold dry air into contact with the warm moist air of the mid latitudes resulting in a rapid and dramatic change of weather known as a cold snap 3 ozone depletion occurs within the polar vortices  particularly over the southern hemisphere  reaching a maximum depletion in the spring history the polar vortex was first described as early as 1853.          [37 however because the specific observations are considered short-term observations starting c 13 years ago there is considerable uncertainty in the conclusions climatology observations require several decades to definitively distinguish natural variability from climate trends citation needed southern hemisphere ozone concentration february 22 2012 the general assumption is that reduced snow cover and sea ice reflect less sunlight and therefore evaporation and transpiration increases which in turn alters the pressure and temperature gradient of the polar vortex causing it to weaken or collapse this becomes apparent when the jet stream amplitude increases meanders over the northern hemisphere causing rossby waves to propagate farther to the south or north which in turn transports warmer air to the north pole and polar air into lower latitudes the jet stream amplitude increases with a weaker polar vortex hence increases the chance for weather systems to become blocked a recent blocking event emerged when a high-pressure over greenland steered hurricane sandy into the northern mid-atlantic states 38 ozone depletion the chemistry of the antarctic polar vortex has created severe ozone depletion the nitric acid in polar stratospheric clouds reacts with chlorofluorocarbons to form chlorine which catalyzes the photochemical destruction of ozone 39 chlorine concentrations build up during the polar winter and the consequent ozone destruction is greatest when the sunlight returns in spring 40 these clouds can only form at temperatures below about 80 c 112 f since there is greater air exchange between the arctic and the mid-latitudes ozone depletion at the north pole is much less severe than at the south 41 accordingly the seasonal reduction of ozone levels over the arctic is usually characterized as an ozone dent whereas the more severe ozone depletion over the antarctic is considered an ozone hole this said chemical ozone destruction in the 2011 arctic polar vortex attained for the first time a level clearly identifiable as an arctic ozone hole citation needed outside earth hubble view of the colossal polar cloud on mars other astronomical bodies are also
