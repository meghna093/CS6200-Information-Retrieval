grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale one of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper potomac river was at the mouth of hunting creek 6 however the ground proved to be unsuitable and the warehouse was built half a mile up-river where the water was deep near the shore following the 1745 settlement of the virginia's 10 year dispute with lord fairfax over the western boundary of the northern neck proprietary when the privy council in london found in favor of lord fairfax's expanded claim some of the fairfax county gentry formed the ohio company of virginia they intended to conduct trade into the interior of america and they required a trading center near the head of navigation on the potomac the best location was hunting creek tobacco warehouse since the deep water could easily accommodate sailing ships many local tobacco planters however wanted a new town further up hunting creek away from nonproductive fields along the river 7 around 1746 captain philip alexander ii 17041753 moved to what is south of present duke street in alexandria his estate which consisted of 500 acres 2.0 km2 was bounded by hunting creek hooff's run the potomac river and approximately the line which would become cameron street at the opening of virginia's 174849 legislative session there was a petition submitted in the house of burgesses on november 1 1748 that the inhabitants of fairfax co  praying that a town may be established at hunting creek warehouse on potowmack river  as hugh west was the owner of the warehouse the petition was introduced by lawrence washington 17181752 the representative for fairfax county and more importantly the son-in-law of william fairfax and a founding member of the ohio company to support the company's push for a town on the river lawrence's younger brother george washington an aspiring surveyor made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site 8 since the river site was amidst his estate philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of hunting creek also known as great hunting creek it has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town alexandria in honor of philip's family as a result philip and his cousin captain john alexander 17111763 gave land to assist in the development of alexandria and are thus listed as the founders this john was the son of robert alexander ii 16881735 on may 2 1749 the house of burgesses approved the river location and ordered mr washington do go up with a message to the council and acquaint them that this house have agreed to the amendments titled an act for erecting a town at hunting creek warehouse in the county of fairfax 9 a public vendue auction was advertised for july and the county surveyor laid out street lanes and town lots the auction was conducted on july 1314 1749 almost immediately upon establishment the town founders called the new town belhaven believed to be in honor of a scottish patriot john hamilton 2nd lord belhaven and stenton the northern neck tobacco trade being then dominated by scots the name belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a church and market house but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s 10 the town of alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779 in 1755 general edward braddock organized his fatal expedition against fort duquesne at carlyle house in alexandria in april 1755 the governors of

charles lee the society did not last for long however on july 24 1794 the founders of the society once again met at wise's home to establish a subscription library during the first year one hundred nineteen men joined the circulating library which was to be called the library company of alexandria members agreed to pay an initiation fee and annual dues the company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the general assembly of virginia first city library location within an apothecary shop druggist edward stabler was elected the first librarian and the library's first location is believed to have been housed in his apothecary shop james kennedy was elected the second librarian and the library moved to his residence and place of business kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the library company those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library the first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797 the collection grew over time bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books most members were initially men although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798 one noted female member in 1817 was mary l f custis wife of george washington parke custis the catalog published in 1801 indicated a collection of 452 books mostly on history and travel by 1815 there were 1,022 entries in the catalog and the collection had added more biographies fiction and magazines the library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years including the new market house next to the city hall the lyceum company building and peabody hall which was owned by the alexandria school board raising funds for the library was a continuing challenge in 1853 a lecture series was created to raise money speakers included professor joseph henry of the smithsonian colonel francis h smith of the virginia military institute and humorist george w bagby the arrival of the civil war in 1861 took its toll on the library collection members were able to remove some of the collection prior to the library's occupation by union troops the library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time after the war the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove what was left of the collection funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879 the library company closed the remainder of its collection was stored in peabody hall in 1897 a group of women in alexandria formed the alexandria library association the leaders of the group were virginia corse mrs william b smoot and virginia burke they petitioned the school board to open a subscription library in peabody hall using the old books stored there permission was given and doors to the new subscription library opened on december 1 1897 in 1902 the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of prince street while negotiations were underway for a permanent move to the confederate hall located at 806 prince street in may 1903 the library moved to the confederate hall now known as the robert e lee camp hall museum where it stayed for 34 years in 1936 dr and mrs robert south barrett presented a proposal to the library association they agreed to donate a building in memory of dr barrett's mother kate waller barrett if the city would commit to running it as a public library the city agreed and the society of friends offered a 99-year lease on an old quaker graveyard located on queen street the old library was closed on march 1 for the books to be packed and moved to the new library which opened to the public in august 1937 the alexandria library association became the alexandria library society in 1939 the barrett library was the scene of possibly the nation's first sit-in demonstrations as samuel tucker a young law school graduate
