weather forecasting  wikipedia weather forecaster redirects here for other uses see weatherman disambiguation weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change once a human-only endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure current weather conditions and sky condition weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account 1 human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon which involves pattern recognition skills teleconnections knowledge of model performance and knowledge of model biases the inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere the error involved in measuring the initial conditions and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes hence forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made the range of the forecast increases the use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome there are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture and therefore to traders within commodity markets temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days on an everyday basis people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and wind chill forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead and survive them in 2014 the us spent 5.1 billion on weather forecasting 2 history ancient forecasting for millennia people have tried to forecast the weather in 650 bc the babylonians predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as astrology in about 350 bc aristotle described weather patterns in meteorologica 3 later theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting called the book of signs 4 chinese weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 300 bc 5 which was also around the same time ancient indian astronomers developed weather-prediction methods 6 in new testament times christ himself referred to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns by saying when evening comes you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning today it will be stormy for the sky is red and overcast  you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times 7 in 904 ad ibn wahshiyya's nabatean agriculture discussed the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations signs of rain based on observation of the lunar phases and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds 8 ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events also termed pattern recognition for example it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red the following day often brought fair weather this experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore however not all          [44 reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems that cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance or are expected to be of high impact 37 days into the future over the downstream continent 45 models are initialized using this observed data the irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms usually an evenly spaced grid the data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast 46 commonly the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations these equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined the rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future the equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future this time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time the length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid the length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid and is chosen to maintain numerical stability 47 time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes 48 while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes 49 the global models are run at varying times into the future the met office's unified model is run six days into the future 50 the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts model is run out to 10 days into the future 51 while the global forecast system model run by the environmental modeling center is run 16 days into the future 52 the visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart or prog 53 the raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast this can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts 54 mos or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance this guidance is presented in coded numerical form and can be obtained for nearly all national weather service reporting stations in the united states as proposed by edward lorenz in 1963 long range forecasts those made at a range of two weeks or more are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved in numerical models extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity 55 essentially a model is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes within any modern model is a set of equations known as the primitive equations used to predict the future state of the atmosphere 56 these equationsalong with the ideal gas laware used to evolve the density pressure and potential temperature scalar fields and the velocity vector field of the atmosphere through time additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive-equation mesoscale models as well 57 the equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods 58 with the exception of a few idealized cases 59 therefore numerical methods obtain approximate solutions different models use different solution methods some global models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite difference methods for the vertical dimension while regional models and other global models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions 58 techniques persistence the simplest method of forecasting the weather persistence relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow this can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state such as during the summer season in the tropics this method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern therefore when in a fluctuating weather pattern this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate it can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts 60 use of a barometer measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency the change of pressure over time have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century 61 the larger the change in pressure especially if more than 3.5 hpa 2.6 mmhg the larger the change in weather can be expected if the pressure drop is rapid a low pressure system is approaching and there is a greater chance of rain rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions such as clearing skies 62 looking at the sky marestail shows moisture at high altitude signalling the later arrival of wet weather along with pressure tendency the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future at night high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain 63 morning fog portends fair conditions as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation the approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future 64 a bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone the use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries 65 nowcasting main article nowcasting meteorology the forecasting of the weather within the next six hours is often referred to as nowcasting 66 in this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model a human given the latest radar satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours 67 however there are now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation including evolution of those features in time use of forecast models an example of 500 mbar geopotential height prediction from a numerical weather prediction model in the past the human forecaster was responsible for generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations 68 today human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters such as model biases and performance 69 using a consensus of forecast models as well as ensemble members of the various models can help reduce forecast error 70 however regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run 71 humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast while increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans may no longer be needed in the forecast process at some point in the future there is currently still a need for human intervention 72 analog technique the analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event that is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event what makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future 73 some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition it remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans 74 as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future a similar technique is used in medium range forecasting which is known as teleconnections when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime 75 an example of teleconnections are by using el nio-southern oscillation enso related phenomena 76 quality assessment this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it december 2016 mathematical models are often developed to map the forecast skill of a weather prediction methodology communicating forecasts to the public an example of a two-day weather forecast in the visual style that an american newspaper might use temperatures are given in fahrenheit most end users of forecasts are members of the general public thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths power outages 77 and widespread hail damage heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still 78 as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas 79 excessive heat or cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation several countries employ government agencies to provide forecasts and watches warnings advisories to the public in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must be taken into account to present the information in a useful and understandable way examples include the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's national weather service nws [80 and environment canada's meteorological service msc 81 traditionally newspaper television and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public increasingly the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found 82 in all cases these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis severe weather alerts and advisories a major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected this is done to protect life and property 83 some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch other forms of these advisories include winter weather high wind flood tropical cyclone and fog 84 severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media including radio using emergency systems as the emergency alert system which break into regular programming 85 low temperature forecast the low temperature forecast for the current day is calculated using the lowest temperature found between 7pm that evening through 7am the following morning 86 so in short today's forecasted low is most likely tomorrow's low temperature specialist forecasting there are a number of sectors with their own specific needs for weather forecasts and specialist services are provided to these users air traffic ash cloud from the 2008 eruption of chaitn volcano stretching across patagonia from the pacific to the atlantic ocean see also terminal aerodrome forecast because the aviation industry is especially sensitive to the weather accurate weather forecasting is essential fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off 87 turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards 88 thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries 89 icing due to the heavy precipitation as well as large hail strong winds and lightning all of which can cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight 90 volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds 91 on a day-to-day basis airliners are routed to take advantage of the jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency 92 aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination 93 additionally airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind this reduces the distance required for takeoff and eliminates potential crosswinds 94 marine see also marine weather forecasting commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed wave periodicity and heights tides and precipitation these factors can each influence the safety of marine transit consequently a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio for example the mafor marine forecast 95 typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of rtty navtex and radiofax agriculture farmers rely on weather forecasts to decide what work to do on any particular day for example drying hay is only feasible in dry weather prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton wheat 96 and corn crops while corn crops can be ruined by drought their dried remains can be used as a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage 97 frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall for example peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze 98 orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes regardless of their timing 99 forestry weather forecasting of wind precipitations and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling wildfires different indices like the forest fire weather index and the haines index have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather too utility companies an air handling unit is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location click on image for legend main article degree day electricity and gas companies rely on weather forecasts to anticipate demand which can be strongly affected by the weather they use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating heating degree day or cooling cooling degree day these quantities are based on a daily average temperature of 65 f 18 c cooler temperatures force heating degree days one per degree fahrenheit while warmer temperatures force cooling degree days 100 in winter severe cold weather can cause a surge in demand as people turn up their heating 101 similarly in summer a surge in demand can be linked with the increased use of air conditioning systems in hot weather 102 by anticipating a surge in demand utility companies can purchase additional supplies of power or natural gas before the price increases or in some circumstances supplies are restricted through the use of brownouts and blackouts 103 other commercial companies increasingly private companies pay for weather forecasts tailored to their needs so that they can increase their profits or avoid large losses 104 for example supermarket chains may change the stocks on their shelves in anticipation of different consumer spending habits in different weather conditions weather forecasts can be used to invest in the commodity market such as futures in oranges corn soybeans and oil 105 military applications united kingdom armed forces royal navy the uk royal navy working with the uk met office has its own specialist branch of weather observers and
