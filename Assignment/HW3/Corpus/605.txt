debate can be resolved the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street removing buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the smiths in their home nevertheless the neighborhood is now flooded and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape the house is drifting along the floodwater's current in an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas stan

impaled by a sharp object later the attic starts to fill it with water hayley tries to get the door shut but it's too strong to close off klaus now having the home being flooded can go whenever he

family fights for survival stan loses hope and admits francine's suggestions are better than his own until klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family refusing to accept francine's pleas to just get help stan instead throws a javelin that hits his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear buckle enters the house with a tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting stan who later tells buckle that he made the right call despite the whole ordeal stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis after the storm clears stan looks out to scope the damage done by the storm only to find himself in a stand-off with cleveland brown and peter griffin whose houses have ended up on both sides of the smiths house since the same hurricane hit their respective towns earlier when francine comes out the front door stan accidentally shoots her which peter claims to be classic american dad due to its unpredictability production see also night of the hurricane there were talks initially of doing a crossover with all the characters from all the shows but it became a little bit of a conundrum because you have three different staffs each

interview with the hollywood reporter           [12 macfarlane later agreed with the decisions after being consulted with the executives of fox and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that
