astronomy  wikipediathis article is about the scientific study of celestial objects for other uses see astronomy disambiguation not to be confused with astrology the pseudoscience astronomy from greek  is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena it applies mathematics physics and chemistry in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution objects of interest include planets moons stars galaxies and comets the phenomena include supernova explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation more generally all astronomical phenomena that originate outside earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy a related but distinct subject physical cosmology is concerned with the study of the universe as a whole 1 astronomy is one of the oldest of the natural sciences the early civilizations in recorded history such as the babylonians greeks indians egyptians nubians iranians chinese maya and many ancient indigenous peoples of the americas performed methodical observations of the night sky historically astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry celestial navigation observational astronomy and the making of calendars but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics 2 during the 20th century the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena the two fields complement each other with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs still play an active role especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena amateur astronomers have made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries such as finding new comets etymology 19th century sydney observatory australia 1873 3 19th century quito astronomical observatory is located 12 minutes south of the equator in quito ecuador 4 astronomy from the greek  from  astron star and  nomia from  nomos law or culture means law of the stars or culture of the stars depending on the translation astronomy should not be confused with astrology the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects 5 although the two fields share a common origin they are now entirely distinct 6 use of terms astronomy and astrophysics generally either the term astronomy or astrophysics may be used to refer to this subject 7]                  [102 is the solar system normal or atypical what is the nature of dark matter and dark energy these dominate the
