mbar hpa on september 10 the nhc started to monitor an area of low pressure well south of manzanillo mexico 132 the disturbance gradually organized during the following days and by 09:00 utc on september 14 the system was noted to develop a well-defined center and spiral banding 133 this led to the formation of tropical storm norma skipping tropical depression status 134 the newly formed tropical storm continued to intensify at a steady pace while it moved slowly northward becoming a category 1 hurricane by 03:00 utc on september 16 and reaching winds of 75 mph 120 km h 135 at this time warnings were being required for the southern portions of the baja california peninsula as norma was forecast to become a major hurricane and make landfall in the area 136 however its broad circulation and the entrainment of dry air quickly became an impediment in doing so 137 norma then weakened back to a tropical storm at 21:00 utc later that day while becoming stationary though a developing ridge over mexico began to move the storm slowly towards the north 138 norma maintained its intensity the next day and continued being slowly steered by the ridge towards a northwesterly to west-northwesterly path all tropical storm warnings were discontinued as norma started to shift its track more to the west 139 the cyclone continued weakening for several days as it slowly drifted to the west until finally being declared a remnant low at 03:00 utc on september 20.[140 tropical storm pilar tropical storm sshws duration september 23  september 25 peak intensity 45 mph 75 km h 1-min

disturbance lacked any significant organization until september 23 at around 21:00 utc when the system was noted to developed surface winds of over 35 mph 55 km h becoming tropical depression eighteen-e 143 the depression organized into a tropical storm six hours later and was given the name pilar the sixteenth named storm of the annual pacific hurricane season 144 thereafter despite having a disorganized appearance on satellite pilar's winds increased in strength and it reached its peak with sustained winds of 45 mph 75 km h 145 by 09:00 utc on september 24 pilar continued to track north along the coast with warnings being issued for the southwestern coast of mexico 146 however early on september 25 these warnings were discontinued 147 as tropical storm pilar showed signs of weakening mainly due to land interaction and was reduced to a tropical depression before ultimately dissipating at around 21:00 utc later that same day 148 although pilar did not make landfall as a tropical cyclone heavy rainfall was reported in puerto vallarta mexico northeast of islas maras and in other areas along the mexican coastline 149 tropical storm ramon tropical storm sshws duration october 4  october 5 peak intensity 45 mph 75 km h 1-min 1002 mbar hpa on october 3 the nhc noted a high chance of tropical development in an area of low pressure to the south of mexico 150 the system increased in intensity and became tropical storm ramon early on october 4 skipping tropical depression status 151 due to wind shear from a large anticyclone to its north the storm did not intensify much further 152 although it was forecast to linger over open waters as it moved westward this did not occur and the system quickly grew disorganized 153 ramon weakened into a tropical depression later on the same day having lasted as a tropical storm only for 18 hours 154 as it moved westward ramon continued to weaken until it finally degenerated into a trough of low pressure on october 5 and the national hurricane center issued its last advisory on the degenerated system at 09:00 utc on the same day 155 tropical storm selma tropical storm sshws duration october 27  october 28 peak intensity 40 mph 65 km h 1-min 1005 mbar hpa late on october 24 the nhc began to monitor the formation of an area of low pressure located south of eastern central america 156 the system quickly gained organization as it moved northwestwards 157 and was declared tropical storm selma at 09:00 utc on october 27.[158 this marked only the second time that an eastern pacific tropical cyclone became a tropical storm east of 90w the other being alma of 2008.[158 with the environment thought to be generally conducive to intensification selma was forecast to gain some strength before moving northwards into central america however with wind shear stronger than expected 159 this did not materialize and selma never strengthened beyond minimal tropical storm status 160 eventually at 12:00 utc on october 28 selma made landfall just southeast of san salvador el salvador 161 becoming the first eastern pacific tropical cyclone to make landfall anywhere in el salvador 162 once over land selma weakened quickly and degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone by 21:00 utc on october 28 selma's remnant dissipated overland within the next several hours 163 heavy rains produced by selma and a cold front resulted in flooding that killed seven people in honduras dozens of landslides damaged homes and blocked roadways while 13 rivers topped their banks approximately 38,000 people required evacuation and more than 3,000 homes were flooded as 13 rivers topped their banks 164 rainfall extended into nicaragua causing floods that claimed another 10 lives in areas recovering from tropical
