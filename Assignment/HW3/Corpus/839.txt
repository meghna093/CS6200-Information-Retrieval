[10 it weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern canadian maritimes and crossing the nova scotia peninsula as a hurricane juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over prince edward island by early september 29 later that afternoon the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over the northwestern gulf of saint lawrence 1 preparations the first advisories were issued by the canadian hurricane centre on september 26 although at that time they broadly suggested the possibility existed for wind and rain across atlantic canada 11 as juan approached on september 27 warning broadcasts on local media in atlantic canada were changed accordingly the public and emergency officials in the expected landfall area were told to make preparations for a potential disaster after the chc bulletins indicated the possibility existed for significant wind damage and flooding from both heavy rain and storm surges as well as power outages 12 on the morning of september 28 reports indicated that juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal category 1 hurricane 13 weather broadcasts up to that time gave every indication that the storm would weaken prior to landfall by 6 p m adt 2100 utc additional warnings had been issued since juan was expected to make landfall as a strong category 1 or weak category 2 hurricane 14 most businesses in the areas affected were closed on sundays which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute 15 although no large-scale evacuations were made local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of september 28 in all several hundred people were affected by these evacuations utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit preparing for large-scale power outages 16 impact nova scotia debris on the streets of halifax following the hurricane hurricane juan's maximum sustained wind speed at landfall in nova scotia was measured at 100 mph 155 km h 1 the urban concentration surrounding halifax harbour bore the brunt of the highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during the storm some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as 145 mph 230 km h 17 wave-rider weather buoys off the entrance of halifax harbour snapped their moorings after reportedly recording waves in excess of 65 ft 20 m significant erosion occurred on the populated shores of the harbour particularly in the bedford basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of the wave action storm surges of 5 to 7 feet 1.5 to 2 m were reported in the harbour it was the highest surge ever recorded in halifax harbour 18 rainfall was fairly light due to the fast movement and dry air on the southern side of the storm there were no rainfall reports greater than 2 inches 52 mm 19 juan caused widespread structural and vegetation damage across the region particularly in and around the halifax regional municipality extensive damage to trees was reported which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines many homes and businesses suffered property damage particularly roof damage on structures and some weaker structures were destroyed 2 hrm estimated that 31 of residential homes suffered some degree of damage and 27 of homes had enough damage to warrant an insurance claim 20 in downtown halifax erosion-control boulders the size of garbage cans were hurled from halifax harbour onto boardwalks and parking lots and piers the victoria general hospital experienced roof and water damage and was evacuated during the storm as were numerous tall apartment buildings and other multi-family residences 21 billboards and signs were also destroyed and dozens of vehicles were crushed by trees and other debris 2 the city's cherished point pleasant park and public gardens suffered massive loss of trees and remained closed for months damage to the halifax public gardens after hurricane juan juan set an all-time maximum wind gust speed record at the halifax stanfield international airport during the peak of the storm a gust reached 143 km h a record which still stands to this day another high windspeed occurred at the mcnabs island autostation which recorded a 2-minute sustained wind of 151 km h with gusts to 176 km h hurricane-force gusts extended as far east as beaver island where gusts reached 132 km h the hurricane was strong enough to destroy the anemometers at shannon hill chebucto head and sambro island even though the sambro island instrument had survived a 193 km h storm some years earlier 22 the hurricane caused severe damage to shipping in halifax harbour a visiting recreational schooner named larinda was sunk at the wharf beside the maritime museum of the atlantic and a harbour tour ketch mar was driven ashore in eastern passage on the opposite side of halifax harbour another harbour tour vessel the tern schooner silva broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the cable wharf on the halifax waterfront dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the bedford basin and northwest arm dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the south end container terminal wharves on the halifax and dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the dartmouth railway yard one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the bedford basin near millview coastal flooding was also reported around halifax harbour as a result of the storm surge 18 although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to juan's fast forward movement 2 less severe property damage was recorded west of the storm's track into st margarets bay and mahone bay in addition to halifax regional municipality's urban core the town of truro and all of rural colchester county as well as the western part of pictou county experienced property damage and power outages from falling trees numerous barns and other agricultural buildings were damaged east of the storm's path including a replica of the hector in pictou harbour 2 the severity of property damage in the metropolitan areas of halifax and dartmouth of halifax regional municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that juan was likely a category 3 hurricane however the sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion many of the deciduous trees in central nova scotia still had leaves which magnified the effects of wind damage 23 overall the number of damaged trees was estimated to be in the millions 2 juan claimed six lives two directly in nova scotia both of the direct deaths were due to fallen trees one was a halifax paramedic and the other was a motorist in enfield 24 three of the four indirect deaths were as a result of a house fire started by candles when electricity was cut and the fourth was in relief work after the storm 2 rest of atlantic canada rainfall from hurricane juan when the storm tracked across nova scotia and into the northumberland strait it was still a category 1 hurricane weakening to a tropical storm as it emerged into the gulf of saint lawrence wind gusts of 86 mph 139 km h were reported in charlottetown[3 and 67 mph 107 km h in the iles de la madeleine in the gulf of saint lawrence 1 damage was also reported in prince edward island as a result of the storm particularly around charlottetown where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city's downtown core extensive tree damage was also reported across the island as well as structural damage to weaker buildings such as barns and silos 2 the hurricane left portions of the island without power 25 the narrow path meant that damage was quite localized little damage was reported in new brunswick or western prince edward island 26 voting in the pei general election on september 29 was also disrupted though more than 80 of voters made it to polling stations 27 two deaths were reported in the gulf of saint lawrence off the remote anticosti island in quebec they were fishermen from new brunswick operating near anticosti island 2 aftermath see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names halifax waterfront after hurricane juan in the hours following the storm a state of emergency was declared in halifax regional municipality and parts of neighbouring east hants municipal district and colchester county the government of nova scotia requested that the federal government deploy 600 canadian forces personnel to assist local authorities in hrm with cleanup in the urban area and to assist utility crews with electrical power restoration 28 many utility workers especially those employed by nova scotia power and the dozens of crews from maritime electric and nb power who responded under mutual assistance agreements worked for almost three weeks without any considerable amount of rest 2 many residents praised utility crews for their hard work in restoring the extensive damage the devastated point pleasant park remained closed for cleanup after the storm before re-opening in june 2004 nine months after the storm hit with a damaged shoreline and almost 85 of its trees removed a revitalization and reforestation program began in 2005.[29 the government of nova scotia pledged 10 million 2003 cad in relief money after the hurricane hit and private contributions were also made quickly after the storm hit 30 prince edward island also pledged 200,000 2003 cad immediately after the hurricane hit 31 and the federal government also announced their own package 32 the mayor of toronto at the time mel lastman also contributed 50,000 2003 cad to replace damaged trees in prince edward island 33 hurricane juan alerted residents governments utilities and emergency management agencies throughout atlantic canada to improve preparations for devastating events such as hurricanes especially with climatological data pointing to possible increased frequency of major ocean storms and extratropical cyclones in addition to juan three other storms  fabian isabel and kate  had a significant effect on land or offshore in canada during the 2003 atlantic hurricane season 34 preparations and planning have been underway since 2003 and were first tested when hurricane ophelia was forecast to brush near nova scotia in early september 2005.[35 hurricane juan has also resulted in several changes to the meteorological service of canada's canadian hurricane centre which has relocated from a vulnerable and exposed location in an office building in dartmouth nova scotia to a more secure location that can withstand hurricane damage chc's hurricane warning system has also been improved traditionally chc did not issue standard hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings just high wind and heavy rainfall warnings which were often not heeded by local residents beginning in the 2004 atlantic hurricane season chc began using standard hurricane warnings for storms potentially affecting canada 36 canada issued its first hurricane warning in 2008 in anticipation of hurricane kyle and in 2009 issued its second hurricane watch in anticipation of hurricane bill hurricane juan lent its name to a severe blizzard that struck nova scotia and prince edward island a few months later in february 2004 which quickly became known as white juan because the paralyzing effects of the massive snowfall evoked the recent hurricane retirement because of its effects in canada the name juan was retired in april 2004 and will never be used again for an atlantic hurricane environment canada noted that its request for retirement was in consideration of the lost and damaged lives the impact to economy and the widespread destruction of trees throughout two provinces 37 it was the first time that the meteorological service of canada had specifically requested a hurricane name be retired 38 the name was replaced by joaquin for the 2009 season but since it was not used during that year it was used in the 2015 season although it was later retired see also tropical cyclones portal list of atlantic hurricanes other storms of the same name list of retired atlantic hurricane names hurricane arthur
