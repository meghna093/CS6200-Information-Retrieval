eyewall replacement cycle  wikipedia eyewall replacement cycles also called concentric eyewall cycles naturally occur in intense tropical cyclones generally with winds greater than 185 km h 115 mph or major hurricanes category 3 or above when tropical cyclones reach this intensity and the eyewall contracts or is already sufficiently small some of the outer rainbands may strengthen and organize into a ring of thunderstormsan outer eyewallthat slowly moves inward and robs the inner eyewall of its needed moisture and angular momentum since the strongest winds are in a cyclone's eyewall the tropical cyclone usually weakens during this phase as the inner wall is choked by the outer wall eventually the outer eyewall replaces the inner one completely and the storm may re-intensify 1 the discovery of this process was partially responsible for the end of the u s government's hurricane modification experiment project stormfury this project set out to seed clouds outside the eyewall apparently causing a new eyewall to form and weakening the storm when it was discovered that this was a natural process due to hurricane dynamics the project was quickly abandoned 2 almost every intense hurricane undergoes at least one of these cycles during its existence recent studies have shown that nearly half of all tropical cyclones and nearly all cyclones with sustained winds over 204 kilometres per hour 127 mph 110 kn undergo eyewall replacement cycles 3 hurricane allen in 1980 went through repeated eyewall replacement cycles fluctuating between category 5 and category 3 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale several times hurricane juliette 2001 was a rare documented case of triple eyewalls 4 typhoon june 1975 was the first reported case of triple eyewalls 5 history 1966 photo of the crew and personnel of project stormfury the first tropical system to be observed with concentric eyewalls was typhoon sarah by fortner in 1956 which he described as an eye within an eye 6 the storm was observed by a reconnaissance aircraft to have an inner eyewall at 6 kilometres 3.7 mi and an outer eyewall at 28 kilometres 17 mi during a subsequent flight 8 hours later the inner eyewall had disappeared the outer eyewall had reduced to 16 kilometres 9.9 mi and the maximum sustained winds and hurricane intensity had decreased 6 the next hurricane observed to have concentric eyewalls was hurricane donna in 1960.    [23 death of the inner eyewall after the secondary eyewall totally surrounds the inner eyewall it begins to affect the tropical cyclone dynamics hurricanes are fueled by the high ocean temperature sea surface temperatures immediately underneath a tropical cyclone can be several degrees cooler than those at the periphery of a storm and therefore cyclones are dependent upon receiving the energy from the ocean from the inward spiraling winds when an outer eyewall is formed the moisture and angular momentum necessary for the maintenance of the inner eyewall is now being used to sustain the outer eyewall causing the inner eye to weaken and dissipate leaving the tropical cyclone with one eye that is larger in diameter than the previous eye a microwave pass of cyclone phailin revealing the moat between the inner and outer eyewalls in the moat region between the inner and outer eyewall observations by dropsondes have shown high temperatures and dewpoint depressions the eyewall contracts because of inertial instability 24 contraction of the eyewall occurs if the area of convection occurs outside the radius of maximum winds after the outer eyewall forms subsidence increases rapidly in the moat region 25 once the inner eyewall dissipates the storm weakens the central pressure increases and the maximum sustained windspeed decreases rapid changes in the intensity of tropical cyclones is a typical characteristic of eyewall replacement cycles 25 compared to the processes involved with the formation of the secondary eyewall the death of the inner eyewall is fairly well understood some tropical cyclones with extremely large outer eyewalls do not experience the contraction of the outer eye and subsequent dissipation of the inner eye typhoon winnie 1997 developed an outer eyewall with a diameter of 200 kilometres 120 mi that did not dissipate until it reached the shoreline 26 the time required for the eyewall to collapse is inversely related to the diameter of the eyewall which is mostly because inward directed wind decreases asymptotically to zero with distance from the radius of maximum winds but also due to the distance required to collapse the eyewall 24 throughout the entire vertical layer of the moat there is dry descending air the dynamics of the moat region are similar to the eye while the outer eyewall takes on the dynamics of the primary eyewall the vertical structure of the eye has two layers the largest layer is that from the top of the tropopause to a capping layer around 700 hpa which is described by descending warm air below the capping layer the air is moist and has convection with the presence of stratocumulus clouds the moat gradually takes on the characteristics of the eye upon which the inner eyewall can only dissipate in strength as the majority of the inflow is now being used to maintain the outer eyewall the inner eye is eventually evaporated as it is warmed by the surrounding dry air in the moat and eye models and observations show that once the outer eyewall completely surrounds the inner eye it takes less than 12 hours for the complete dissipation of the inner eyewall the inner eyewall feeds mostly upon the moist air in the lower portion of the eye before evaporating 14 evolution into an annular hurricane main article annular tropical cyclone annular hurricanes have a single eyewall that is larger and circularly symmetric observations show that an eyewall replacement cycle can lead to the development of an annular hurricane while some hurricanes develop into annular hurricanes without an eyewall replacement it has been hypothesized that the dynamics leading to the formation of a secondary eyewall may be similar to those needed for development of an annular eye 13 hurricane daniel 2006 and typhoon winnie 1997 were examples where a storm had an eyewall replacement cycle and then turned into an annular hurricane 27 annular hurricanes have been simulated that have gone through the life cycle of an eyewall replacement the simulations show that the major rainbands will grow such that the arms will overlap and then it spiral into itself to form a concentric eyewall the inner eyewall dissipates leaving a hurricane with a singular large eye with no rainbands 28 references further reading books paul v kislow 2008 hurricanes background history and bibliography nova publishers p 50
