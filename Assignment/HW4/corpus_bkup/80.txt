forecasting weather portal v t e jet streams are fast flowing narrow meandering air currents in the atmospheres of some planets including earth 1 on earth the main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds flowing west to east their paths typically have a meandering shape jet streams may start stop split into two or more parts combine into one stream or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet the strongest jet streams are the polar jets at 912 km 30,00039,000 ft above sea level and the higher altitude and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at 1016 km 33,00052,000 ft the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere each have a polar jet and a subtropical jet the northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of north america europe and asia and their intervening oceans while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles antarctica all year round jet streams are the product of two factors the atmospheric heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale polar ferrel and hadley circulation cells and the action of the coriolis force acting on those moving masses the coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis on other planets internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams the polar jet stream forms near the interface of the polar and ferrel circulation cells while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the ferrel and hadley circulation cells 2 other jet streams also exist during the northern hemisphere summer easterly jets can form in tropical regions typically where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central united states meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting the main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines often the airlines work to fly with the jet stream for this reason dynamic north atlantic tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users clear-air turbulence a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety is often found in a jet stream's vicinity but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times these are a narrow belt discovery after the 1883 eruption of the krakatoa volcano weather watchers tracked and mapped the effects on the sky over several years they labelled the phenomenon the equatorial smoke stream 3]               [59 since 2007 and particularly in 2012 and early 2013 the jet stream has been at an abnormally low latitude across the uk lying closer to the english channel around 50n rather than its more usual north of scotland latitude of around 60n not in citation given however between 1979 and 2001 it has been found that the average position of the jet stream has been moving northward at a rate of 2.01 kilometres 1.25 mi per year across the northern hemisphere across north america this type of change could lead to drier conditions across the southern tier of the united states and more frequent and more intense tropical cyclones in the tropics a similar slow poleward drift was found when studying the southern hemisphere jet stream over the same time frame 60 other upper-level jets polar night jet this article or section appears to contradict itself please see the talk page for more information december 2016 the polar-night jet stream forms only during the winter months when the nights are much longer hence polar nights in their respective hemispheres at around 60 latitude the polar night jet moves at a greater height of about 80,000 feet 24,000 m than it does during the summer 61 during these dark months the air high over the poles becomes much colder than the air over the equator this difference in temperature gives rise to extreme air pressure differences in the stratosphere which when combined with the coriolis effect create the polar night jets that race eastward at an altitude of about 30 miles 48 km 62 the polar vortex is circled by the polar night jet the warmer air can only move along the edge of the polar vortex but not enter it within the vortex the cold polar air becomes increasingly cold with neither warmer air from lower latitudes nor energy from the sun during the polar night 63 low level jets there are wind maxima at lower levels of the atmosphere that are also referred to as jets barrier jet a barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains the mountain barrier increases the strength of the low level wind by 45 percent 64 in the north american great plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours 65 a similar phenomenon develops across australia which pulls moisture poleward from the coral sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent 66 valley exit jet a valley exit jet is a strong down-valley elevated air current that emerges above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain these winds frequently reach a maximum of 20 m s 45 mph or 72 km h at a height of 40200 m above the ground surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation but are significantly weaker they are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal mountain wind systems such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the us deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases 67 africa see also african easterly jet the mid-level african easterly jet occurs during the northern hemisphere summer between 10n and 20n above west africa and the nocturnal poleward low-level jet occurs in the great plains of east and south africa 68 the low-level easterly african jet stream is considered to play a crucial role in the southwest monsoon of africa 69 and helps form the tropical waves which move across the tropical atlantic and eastern pacific oceans during the warm season 70 the formation of the thermal low over northern africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from june into october 71 see also atmospheric river block meteorology polar vortex surface weather analysis sting jet tornado wind shear weather references external
