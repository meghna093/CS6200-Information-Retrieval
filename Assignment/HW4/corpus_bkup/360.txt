la nia  wikipediafor the ship see nia la nia lninj spanish pronunciation la nia is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of el nio as part of the broader el niosouthern oscillation climate pattern the name la nia originates from spanish meaning the little girl analogous to el nio meaning the little boy it has also in the past been called anti-el nio 1 and el viejo meaning the old man 2 during a period of la nia the sea surface temperature across the equatorial eastern central pacific ocean will be lower than normal by 3 to 5 c in the united states an appearance of la nia persists for at least five months it has extensive effects on the weather in north america even affecting the atlantic and pacific hurricane seasons definition la nia is the positive phase of the el nio southern oscillation and is associated with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean 3 however each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a la nia event which is tailored to their specific interests 4 for example the australian bureau of meteorology looks at the trade winds soi weather models and sea surface temperatures in the nio 3 and 3.4 regions before declaring that a la nia event has started 5 however the japan meteorological agency declares that a la nia event has started when the average five-month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino.3 region is more than 0.5 c 0.90 f cooler for 6 consecutive months or longer 6 occurrences a timeline of all la nia episodes between 1900 and 2017.
