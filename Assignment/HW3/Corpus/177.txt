heat  wikipediathis article is about a mode of transfer of energy for other uses see heat disambiguation heat is the amount of energy that flows spontaneously from a warmer object to a cooler one more generally heat arises from many microscopic-scale changes to the objects and can be defined as the amount of transferred energy excluding both macroscopic work and transfer of part of the object itself 1]                            [71 this traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial non-uniformity of temperature and is by conduction and radiation from hotter to colder bodies it is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on circular reasoning against this proposal there stands the rigorously logical mathematical development of the theory presented by truesdell and bharatha 1977 72 this alternative approach to the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat differs in logical structure from that of carathodory recounted just above this alternative approach admits calorimetry as a primary or direct way to measure quantity of energy transferred as heat it relies on temperature as one of its primitive concepts and used in calorimetry 73 it is presupposed that enough processes exist physically to allow measurement of differences in internal energies such processes are not restricted to adiabatic transfers of energy as work they include calorimetry which is the commonest practical way of finding internal energy differences 74 the needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic in contrast the carathodory way recounted just above does not use calorimetry or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat the carathodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat as recounted in more detail just above the carathodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity it is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system and from the actual work done by the system during the process that internal energy difference is supposed to have been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work processes that take the system between the initial and final states by the carathodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat this presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the carathodory way in fact the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist 75 heat transfer in engineering this section does not cite any sources

from which heat transfer to the surrounding environment will be primarily through radiation the discipline of heat transfer typically considered an aspect of mechanical engineering and chemical engineering deals with specific applied methods by which thermal energy in a system is generated or converted or transferred to another system although the definition of heat implicitly means the transfer of energy the term heat transfer encompasses this traditional usage in many engineering disciplines and laymen language heat transfer includes the mechanisms of heat conduction thermal radiation and mass transfer in engineering the term convective heat transfer is used to describe the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow from the thermodynamic point of view heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy the fluid then transfers advects this increased internal energy not heat from one location to another and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system again by diffusion this entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer although technically heat transfer and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow but not as a result of flow thus conduction can be said to transfer heat only as a net result of the process but may not do so at every time within the complicated convective process although distinct physical laws may describe the behavior of each of these methods real systems often exhibit a complicated combination which are often described by a variety of mathematical methods further explanation needed see also energy portal effect of sun angle on climate heat death of the universe heat diffusion heat equation heat

relativistic heat conduction waste heat references quotations  denbigh states in a footnote that he is indebted to correspondence with professor e a guggenheim and with professor n k adam from this denbigh concludes it seems however that when a system is able to exchange both heat and matter with its environment it is impossible to make an unambiguous distinction between energy transported as heat and by the migration of matter without already assuming the existence of the heat of transport  denbigh k g 1951 p 56  heat must therefore consist of either living force or of attraction through space in the former case we can conceive the constituent particles of heated bodies to be either in whole or in part in a state of motion in the latter we may suppose the particles to be removed by the process of heating so as to exert attraction through greater space i am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good that in some instances particularly in the case of sensible heat or such as is indicated by the thermometer heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced whilst in others particularly in the case of latent heat the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space  joule j p 1884 bibliography of cited
