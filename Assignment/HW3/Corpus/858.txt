october 14 1924 dissipated october 23 1924 highest winds 1-minute sustained 165 mph 270 km h lowest pressure 910 mbar hpa 26.87 inhg fatalities around 90 total areas affected central america yucatn peninsula cuba florida the bahamas part of the 1924 atlantic hurricane season the 1924 cuba hurricane is the earliest officially classified category 5 atlantic hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale and one of two hurricanes to make landfall on cuba at category 5 intensity the other being hurricane irma in 2017 it formed on october 14 in the western caribbean slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward by october 16 it attained hurricane status to the east of the yucatn peninsula and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop on october 18 the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening and the next day it reached an estimated peak intensity of 165 mph 270 km h shortly thereafter it struck extreme western cuba at peak intensity becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country later the hurricane weakened greatly striking southwestern florida with winds of 90 mph 150 km h in a sparsely populated region while crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status and after accelerating east-northeastward it was absorbed by a cold front on october 23 south of bermuda across the western caribbean sea the developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds strong winds in western cuba caused severe damage with two small towns nearly destroyed about 90 people were killed in the country all in pinar del ro province later the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern florida which caused flooding and crop damage damage was light in the state and there were no casualties meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale on october 14 a tropical depression was first observed over the western caribbean sea just off the eastern honduras coast it was a large and weak tropical cyclone moving slowly northwestward and gradually intensifying on october 15 it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status and its strengthening became more steady the next day the storm reached hurricane status about 130 mi 215 km southeast of cozumel quintana roo around that time it began to execute a small counterclockwise loop off the east coast of the yucatn peninsula by october 18 the hurricane completed the loop during which its winds increased to 115 mph 185 km h this is the equivalence of a major hurricane or a category 3 on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale the estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained winds by ships and land stations 1 beginning late on october 18 as it tracked north-northeastward toward cuba the hurricane underwent rapid deepening evidenced by a ship wind report of 120 mph 193 km h this wind report was initially thought to be the peak intensity of the cyclone however subsequent research confirmed further deepening based on very low pressures recorded across the region a ship in the radius of maximum winds reported a reading of 922 mbar the barometer on the ship was found to be 5 mbar too high resulting in a pressure of 917 mbar 1 additionally a station on land reported a pressure of 932 mbar 27.52 inhg 2 based on the readings the hurricane research division estimated the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 910 mbar very near the western coast of cuba this suggested peak winds of 165 mph 270 km h late on october 19 the hurricane made landfall in extreme western cuba in pinar del ro province 1 jos carlos mills director of the national observatory at havana believed that this hurricane was one of the most severe ever experienced in our latitudes 2 after exiting cuba into the gulf of mexico the hurricane weakened greatly on october 20 it passed a short distance west of key west florida and very early on october 21 the hurricane moved over marco island with winds of 90 mph 150 km h the cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over miami it accelerated east-northeastward moving over the abaco islands in the bahamas gradually weakening the storm interacted with an approaching cold front late on october 23 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front 1 impact and records as a developing tropical cyclone the storm produced increased winds and lower pressures in the swan islands off the coast of honduras 1 heavy rainfall occurred throughout jamaica causing street flooding and several mudslides but little damage no disruptions were reported to communications or railway travel 3 the storm brushed eastern belize while located off the coast producing 3.62 inches 21.9 mm of rainfall and light winds 4 in extreme western cuba damage was very severe from the strong winds likened to the impact of a tornado severe damage was reported in los arroyos and arroyos de mantua in the latter location around a dozen people were killed 50 were injured and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop 2 across western pinar del ro province the hurricane destroyed all communication links 5 further from the center the capital city of havana recorded southerly winds of 72 mph 116 km h as well as a minimum pressure of about 999 mbar 29.50 inhg 2 around the country the hurricane capsized several ships primarily fishing vessels the death toll in the country was estimated at around 90. [1 a hurricane in 1846 that hit the country was also thought to have struck at category 5 status although the storm existed prior to the start of the atlantic hurricane database 13 when the steamship toledo recorded an atmospheric pressure of 922 mbar 27.22 inhg in the storm it was the lowest pressure recorded in an atlantic hurricane breaking the previous record of 924 mbar 27.28 inhg in the atlantic hurricane of 1853 the record during this storm lasted until the 1932 cuba hurricane when a pressure of 915 mbar 27.02 inhg was reported 14 the reading of 932 mbar 27.52 inhg at los arroyos in mantua pinar del ro remains the lowest pressure recorded on land in cuba 15 see also tropical cyclones portal list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes list of florida hurricanes 1900-1949 hurricane irma references v t e category 5 atlantic hurricanes 1920s cuba 1924 okeechobee 1928 1930s bahamas 1932 cuba 1932 cubabrownsville 1933 tampico 1933 labor day 1935 new england 1938 1950s carol 1953 janet 1955 1960s carla 1961 hattie 1961 beulah 1967 camille 1969 1970s edith 1971 anita 1977 david 1979 1980s allen 1980 gilbert 1988 hugo 1989 1990s andrew 1992 mitch 1998 2000s isabel 2003 ivan 2004 emily 2005 katrina 2005 rita 2005 wilma 2005 dean 2007 felix 2007 2010s matthew 2016 irma 2017 maria 2017 book category tropical cyclones portal
