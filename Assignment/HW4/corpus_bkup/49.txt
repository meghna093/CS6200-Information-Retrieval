tornadoes can be seen during intense fires in combustible building structures or more commonly in forest or bush fires a fire whirl is a vortex-shaped formation of burning gases being released from the combustible material the genesis of the vortex is probably similar to that of a dust devil as distinct from the dust devil it is improbable that the height reached by the fire gas vortex is greater than the visible height of the vertical flames because of turbulence in the surrounding gases that inhibit creation of a stable boundary layer between the rotating rising gases relative to the surrounding gases 25 hot cinders underneath freshly deposited ash in recently burned areas may sometimes generate numerous dust devils the lighter weight and the darker color of the ash may create dust devils that are visible hundreds of feet into the air ash devils form similar to dust devils and are often seen on unstable days in burn scar areas of recent fires this is a photo of an ash devil
