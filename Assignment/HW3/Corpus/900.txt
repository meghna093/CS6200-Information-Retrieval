long march rocket family  wikipediaa long march rocket simplified chinese  traditional chinese  pinyin chngzhng xli ynzi hujin or changzheng rocket in chinese pinyin is any rocket in a family of expendable launch systems operated by the people's republic of china development and design falls under the auspices of the china academy of launch vehicle technology in english the rockets are abbreviated as lm for export and cz within china as chang zheng means long march in chinese pinyin the rockets are named after the long march of chinese communist history history long march 3b launch main article list of long march launches china launched its first satellite known as dong fang hong 1 lit the east is red 1 into earth orbit on its long march space rocket on april 24 1970 becoming the fifth nation to achieve independent launch capability early launches had an inconsistent record focusing on launching of chinese satellites starting in 1990 the long march rocket entered the international market however several setbacks occurred during the early 1990s on january 26 1995 a long march 2e rocket veered off course two seconds after take-off from xichang space center and exploded killing at least six on the ground citation needed on february 14 1996 a similar failure occurred during the launch of intelsat 708 the rocket veered severely off course immediately after clearing the launch tower and crashed into a village 1 following the disaster foreign media were sequestered in a bunker for five hours while some have alleged the chinese military attempted to clean up the damage [22 origins the long march 1 rocket is derived from earlier chinese 2-stage irbm df-4 or dong feng 4 missile and long march 2 long march 3 long march 4 rocket families are derivatives of the chinese 2-stage icbms df-5 or dong feng 5 missile however like its counterparts in both the united states and in russia the differing needs of space rockets and strategic missiles have caused the development of space rockets and missiles to diverge the main goal of a space rocket is to maximize payload while for strategic missiles increased throw weight is much less important than the ability to launch quickly and to survive a first strike this divergence has become clear in the next generation of long march rockets which use cryogenic propellants in sharp contrast to the next generation of strategic missiles which are mobile and solid fuelled the next generation of long march rocket long march 5 rocket family will be a brand new design while long march 6 and long march 7 can be seen as derivations because they use the liquid rocket booster design of long march 5 to build small-to-mid capacity launch vehicles launch sites there are four launch centers in china they are jiuquan satellite launch center taiyuan satellite launch center wenchang satellite launch center xichang satellite launch center most of the commercial satellite launches of long march vehicles have been from xichang satellite launch center located in xichang sichuan province wenchang satellite launch center in hainan province is under expansion and will be the main launch center for future commercial satellite launches long march launches also take place from the more military oriented jiuquan satellite launch center in gansu province from which the manned shenzhou spacecraft also launches taiyuan satellite launch center is located in shanxi province and focuses on the launches of sun-synchronous orbit satellites commercial launch services china markets launch services under the china great wall industry corporation 23 its efforts to launch communications satellites were dealt a blow in the mid-1990s after the united states stopped issuing export licenses to companies to allow them to launch on chinese launch vehicles out of fear that this would help china's military in the face of this thales alenia space built the chinasat-6b satellite with no components from the united states whatsoever this allowed it to be launched on a chinese launch vehicle without violating u s itar restrictions 24 the launch on a long march 3b rocket was successfully conducted on july 5 2007 a
