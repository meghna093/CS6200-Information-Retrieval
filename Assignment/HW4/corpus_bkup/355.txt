el niosouthern oscillation  wikipedia el niosouthern oscillation enso is an irregularly periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern pacific ocean affecting much of the tropics and subtropics the warming phase is known as el nio and the cooling phase as la nia southern oscillation is the accompanying atmospheric component coupled with the sea temperature change el nio is accompanied with high and la nia with low air surface pressure in the tropical western pacific 1]                 [92 paleoclimate records different modes of enso-like events have been registered in paleoclimatic archives showing different triggering methods feedbacks and environmental responses to the geological atmospheric and oceanographic characteristics of the time these paleorecords can be used to provide a qualitative basis for conservation practices 93 references external links wikimedia commons has media related to el nio la niasouthern oscillation latest enso updates  predictions from the international research institute for climate and society noaa faq what is enso el-niosouthern oscillation enso el niosouthern oscillation soi southern oscillation index el-nino la-nina southern oscillation enso animation of enso in victoria australia[permanent dead link v t e climate oscillations climate oscillations 8.2 kiloyear event antarctic circumpolar wave antarctic oscillation arctic dipole anomaly arctic oscillation atlantic equatorial mode atlantic multidecadal oscillation earth's axial tilt bond event dansgaardoeschger event diurnal cycle diurnal temperature variation el niosouthern oscillation el nio  la nia equatorial indian ocean oscillation glacial cycles indian ocean dipole maddenjulian oscillation milankovitch cycles monsoon north atlantic oscillation north pacific oscillation orbital forcing pacific decadal oscillation pacificnorth american teleconnection pattern quasi-biennial oscillation seasonal lag seasons solar variability
