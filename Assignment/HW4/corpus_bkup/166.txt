world energy consumption  wikipediasee also world energy resources and worldwide energy supply this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information october 2014 total primary consumption in the world by fuel 2015 world energy consumption is the total energy used by the entire human civilization typically measured per year it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanity's endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector across every country it does not include energy from food and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented being the power source metric of civilization world energy consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphere institutions such as the international energy agency iea the u s energy information administration eia and the european environment agency record and publish energy data periodically improved data and understanding of world energy consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total primary energy supply tpes which  on a global level  is the sum of energy production minus storage changes since changes of energy storage over the year are minor tpes values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption however tpes ignores conversion efficiency overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency e g coal gas and nuclear and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms e g photovoltaic or hydroelectricity the iea estimates that in 2013 total primary energy supply tpes was 1.575  1017 wh  157.5 pwh 5.67  1020 joules or 13,541 mtoe 2 from 20002012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth the use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth followed by hydropower and renewable energy renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period the demand for nuclear energy decreased in part due to nuclear disasters e g three mile island 1979 chernobyl 1986 and fukushima 2011 1]      :28 oil 31.3 coal peat shale 28.6 natural gas 21.2 biofuels and waste 10.3 hydro electricity 2.4 others renew  1.4 nuclear 4.8 fossil fuels main article fossil fuel the twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold increase in the use of fossil fuels between 1980 and 2006 the worldwide annual growth rate was 2 19 according to the us energy information administration's 2006 estimate the estimated 471.8 ej total consumption in 2004 was divided as given in the table above with fossil fuels supplying 86 of the world's energy coal main articles coal and list of countries by coal production in 2000 china accounted for 28 of world coal consumption other asia consumed 19 north america 25 and the eu 14 the single greatest coal-consuming country is china its share of the world coal production was 28 in 2000 and rose to 48 in 2009 in contrast to china's 70 increase in coal consumption world coal use increased 48 from 2000 to 2009 in practice the majority of this growth occurred in china and the rest in other asia 34 china's energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector the majority of which comes from coal consumption 35 world annual coal production increased 1,905 mt or 32 in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005 of which over 70 was in china and 8 in india coal production was in 2011 7,783 mt and 2009 6,903 mt equal to 12.7 production increase in two years 36 if production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008 proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years this is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the world according to james hansen the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce co2 emissions from coal 37 indonesia and australia exported together 57.1 of the world coal export in 2011 china japan south korea india and taiwan had 65 share of all the world coal import in 2011.
