wind  wikipediafor other uses see wind disambiguation wind from the tacuinum sanitatis wind is the flow of gases on a large scale on the surface of the earth wind consists of the bulk movement of air in outer space solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale their speed the types of forces that cause them the regions in which they occur and their effect the strongest observed winds on a planet in the solar system occur on neptune and saturn winds have various aspects an important one being its velocity wind speed another the density of the gas involved another its energy content or wind energy in meteorology winds are often referred to according to their strength and the direction from which the wind is blowing short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts strong winds of intermediate duration around one minute are termed squalls long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength such as breeze gale storm and hurricane wind occurs on a range of scales from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on earth the two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles and the rotation of the planet coriolis effect within the tropics thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations in coastal areas the sea breeze land breeze cycle can define local winds in areas that have variable terrain mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds in human civilization wind has inspired mythology influenced the events of history expanded the range of transport and warfare and provided a power source for mechanical work electricity and recreation wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across earth's oceans hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft when winds become strong trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed winds can shape landforms via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils such as loess and by erosion dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions wind also affects the spread of wildfires winds can disperse seeds from various plants enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species as well as flying insect populations when combined with cold temperatures wind has a negative impact on livestock wind affects animals food stores as well as their hunting and defensive strategies causes see also atmospheric pressure wind is caused by differences in the atmospheric pressure when a difference in atmospheric pressure exists air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area resulting in winds of various speeds on a rotating planet air will also be deflected by the coriolis effect except exactly on the equator globally the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns the atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces and the rotation of the planet outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance near the earth's surface friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas 1]      wind power has expanded quickly its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1 57 in 2011 wind energy was also used to power the longest journey in a wind powered car which travelled a distance of 5,000 km 3,100 miles from perth to melbourne in australia 58 shear hodograph plot of wind vectors at various heights in the troposphere which is used to diagnose vertical wind shear main article wind shear wind shear sometimes referred to as windshear or wind gradient is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the earth's atmosphere 59 wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast 60 and vertical shear typically near the surface 61 though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft 62 wind shear itself is a microscale meteorological phenomenon occurring over a very small distance but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts it is commonly observed near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms 63 weather fronts areas of locally higher low level winds referred to as low level jets near mountains 64 radiation inversions that occur because of clear skies and calm winds buildings 65 wind turbines 66 and sailboats 67 wind shear has a significant effect during take-off and landing of aircraft because of their effects on control of the aircraft 68 and was a significant cause of aircraft accidents involving large loss of life within the united states 63 sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear which can bend the wave front causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not or vice versa 69 strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development 70 but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather 71 the thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences and explains the existence of the jet stream 72 usage history winds according to aristotle as a natural force the wind was often personified as one or more wind gods or as an expression of the supernatural in many cultures vayu is the hindu god of wind 73]    [162 at the cloud tops of neptune prevailing winds range in speed from 400 meters per second 890 mph along the equator to 250 meters per second 560 mph at the poles 163 at 70 s latitude on neptune a high-speed jet stream travels at a speed of 300 meters per second 670 mph 164 the fastest wind on any known planet is on hd 80606 b located 190 light years away where it blows at more than 11,000 mph or 5 km s 165 see also wikiquote
