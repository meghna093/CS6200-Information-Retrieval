forms of recreation including skiing and sledding common examples include cross-country skiing alpine skiing snowboarding snow shoeing and snowmobiling the design of the equipment used typically relies on the bearing strength of snow as with skis or snowboards and contends with the coefficient of friction of snow to allow sliding often enhance by ski waxes by far the largest form of winter recreation is skiing as of 1994 of the estimated 6575 million skiers worldwide there were approximately 55 million who engaged in alpine skiing the rest engaged in cross-country skiing approximately 30 million skiers of all kinds were in europe 15 million in the us and 14 million in japan as of 1996 there were reportedly 4,500 ski areas operating 26,000 ski lifts and enjoying 390 million skier visits per year the preponderant region for downhill skiing was europe followed by japan and the us 85 increasingly ski resorts are relying on snowmaking the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes 86 snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts 87 this allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring the production of snow requires low temperatures the threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases wet bulb temperature is used as a metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption thereby limiting its use 88 ski wax enhances the ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow which depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the skitoo little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski before a ski can slide it must overcome the maximum value static friction kinetic or dynamic friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow 89 warfare main article cold-weather warfare see also ski warfare snow affects warfare conducted in winter alpine environments or at high latitudes the main factors are impaired visibility for acquiring targets during falling snow enhanced visibility of targets against snowy backgrounds for targeting and mobility for both mechanized and infantry troops snowfall can severely inhibit the logistics of supplying troops as well snow can also provide cover and fortification against small-arms fire 90 noted winter warfare campaigns where snow and other factors affected the operations include the french invasion of russia where poor traction conditions for ill-shod horses made it difficult for supply wagons to keep up with troops 91 that campaign was also strongly affected by cold whereby the retreating army reached neman river in december 1812 with only 10,000 of the 420,000 that had set out to invade russia in june of the same year 92 the winter war an attempt by the soviet union to take territory in finland in late 1939 demonstrated superior winter tactics of the finnish army regarding over-snow mobility camouflage and use of the terrain 93 the battle of the bulge a german counteroffensive during world war ii starting december 16 1944 was marked by heavy snowstorms that hampered allied air support for ground troops but also impaired german attempts to supply their front lines 94 on the eastern front with the nazi invasion of russia in 1941 operation barbarossa both russian and german soldiers had to endure terrible conditions during the russian winter while use of ski infantry was common in the red army germany formed only one division for movement on skis 95 the korean war which lasted from june 25 1950 until an armistice in july 27 1953 began when north korea invaded south korea much of the fighting occurred during winter conditions involving snow 96 notably during the battle of chosin reservoir which was a stark example of cold affecting military operations 97 especially vehicles and weapons 98 bivouac of napoleon's grande arme during the winter retreat from moscow

surface both plant and animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy seasonal dieback survival of seeds and for animals are hibernation insulation anti-freeze chemistry storing food drawing on reserves from within the body and clustering for mutual heat 99 plant life snow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and conversely the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation tree branches especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun snow affects vegetation in several ways the presence of stored water can promote growth yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it furthermore avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation 1 animal life arctic fox a predator of smaller animals that live beneath the snow snow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath many invertebrates thrive in snow including spiders wasps beetles snow scorpionflys and springtails such arthropods are typically active at temperatures down to 5 c 23 f invertebrates fall into two groups regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive the first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce antifreeze agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions some organisms fast during the winter which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts the ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism 99 small vertebrates are active beneath the snow among vertebrates alpine salamanders are active in snow at temperatures as low as 8 c 18 f they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds among mammals those that remain active are typically smaller than 250 grams 8.8 oz omnivores are more likely to enter a torpor or be hibernators whereas herbivores are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow voles store up to 3 kilograms 6.6 lb of food and pikas up to 20 kilograms 44 lb voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth on the surface wolves coyotes foxes lynx and weasels rely on these subsurface dwellers for food and often dive into the snowpack to find them 99 extraterrestrial snow extraterrestrial snow includes water-based precipitation but also precipitation of other compounds prevalent on other planets and moons in the solar system examples are on mars observations of the phoenix mars lander reveal that water-based snow crystals occur at high latitudes 100 additionally carbon dioxide precipitates from clouds during the martian winters at the poles and contributes to a seasonal deposit of that compound which is the principal component of that planet's ice caps 101 on venus observations from the magellan spacecraft reveal the presence a metallic substance which precipitates as venus snow and leaves a highly reflective substance at the tops of venus's highest mountain peaks resembling terrestrial snow given the high temperatures on venus the leading candidates for the precipitate are lead sulfide and bismuth sulfide 102 on saturn's moon titan cassinihuygens spacecraft observations suggest the presence of methane or some other form of hydrocarbon-based crystalline deposits 103 see also snow hydrology lexicon eskimo words for snow the wrong type of snow notable snow events alberta clipper knickerbocker storm 2007 siberian orange
