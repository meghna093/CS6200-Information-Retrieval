maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by tehip and by other government agencies and organizations this web site includes links to databases bibliographies tutorials and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources tehip also is responsible for the toxicology data network toxnet 21 an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web toxmap is a geographic information system gis that is part of toxnet toxmap uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agency's epa toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs computational resources for prediction of toxic peptides and proteins one of the bottlenecks in peptide protein-based therapy is their toxicity recently in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins developed by gajendra pal singh raghava's group 22 predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy the prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides the prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web server 23 misuse of the term when used non-technically the term toxin is often applied to any toxic substance even though the term toxicant would be more appropriate toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed poisons and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to toxic substances in general clarification needed in the context of quackery and alternative medicine the term toxin is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health this could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous pesticides to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation auto-intoxication to food ingredients such as table sugar monosodium glutamate msg and aspartame 24 see also arachnoserver brevetoxin cangitoxin detoxification alternative medicine excitotoxicity insect toxins list of fictional toxins list of highly toxic gases
