dropsonde  wikipediathis article is about the weather reconnaissance device for the album by biosphere see dropsonde album a dropsonde is an expendable weather reconnaissance device created by the national center for atmospheric research ncar designed to be dropped from an aircraft at altitude over water to measure and therefore track storm conditions as the device falls to the surface the sonde contains a gps receiver along with pressure temperature and humidity pth sensors to capture atmospheric profiles and thermodynamic data it typically relays these data to a computer in the aircraft by radio transmission usage a diagram of an ncar gps dropsonde since the early 1970s[1 hurricane hunters have employed dropsondes while flying over the ocean to obtain meteorological data on the structure of hurricanes deemed to be of possible concern to land locations in the northern atlantic and northeastern pacific oceans dropsonde instruments are typically the only way to measurement the wind and pressure near the sea surface within the core of such cyclones allowing meteorologists to reliably establish the storm's intensity and size the data obtained is typically fed into supercomputers for numerical weather prediction enabling forecasters to better track and predict what will happen to the hurricane during a typical hurricane season the 53d weather reconnaissance squadron hurricane hunters deploys 1000 to 1500 sondes on training and storm missions aircraft reconnaissance missions are also sometimes requested to investigate the broader atmospheric structure over the ocean when cyclones may pose a significant threat to the united states these interests include not only potential hurricanes but also possible snow events like nor'easters or significant tornado outbreaks the dropsondes are used to supplement the large gaps over oceans within the global network of daily radiosonde launches typically satellite data provides an estimate of conditions in such areas but the increased precision of sondes can improve forecasts particularly of the storm path dropsondes may also be employed during meteorological research projects device and launch details the sonde is a lightweight system designed to be operated by one person and is launched through a chute installed in the measuring aircraft the device's descent is slowed and stabilized by a small square-cone parachute allowing for more readings to be taken before it reaches the ocean surface the parachute is designed to immediately deploy after release so as to reduce or eliminate any pendulum effect and the device typically drops for three to five minutes the sonde has a casing of stiff cardboard to protect electronics and form a more stable aerodynamic profile to obtain data in a tropical cyclone an aircraft in the us operated either by by noaa or the u s air force flies into the system a series of dropsondes are typically released as the plane passes through the storm typically launched with greatest frequency near the center of the storm including into the eyewall and eye eye center if one exists most drops are performed at a flight level of around 10,000 feet approx 3,000 meters the dropsonde sends back coded data which includes the date and time of the drop time is always in utc location of the drop indicated by the latitude longitude and marsden square the height

itself and other remarks driftsondes dropsonde source us air force a driftsonde is a high altitude durable weather balloon holding a transmitter and a bank 35 in the first models of miniature dropsonde capsules which can then be dropped at automatic intervals or remotely the water-bottle-sized transmitters in the dropsondes have enough power to send information to the balloon during their parachute-controlled fall the balloon carries a larger transmitter powerful enough to relay readings to a satellite the single-use sensor packages cost us 300 to 400 each 2 after being introduced in april 2007 around a thousand a year are expected to be used to track winds in hurricane breeding grounds off of west africa which are outside the operating region of hurricane hunter planes 2 see also
