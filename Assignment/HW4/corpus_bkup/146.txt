rapid intensification  wikipedia rapid intensification is a meteorological condition that occurs when a tropical cyclone intensifies dramatically in a short period of time the united states national hurricane center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots 35 mph 55 km h in a 24-hour period 1 necessary conditions external in order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place water temperatures must be extremely warm near or above 30 c 86 f and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not churn deeper cooler waters up to the surface wind shear must be low when wind shear is high the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted internal usually an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as wellfor extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently 2]    [16 in august 2014 hurricane genevieve underwent explosive intensification while crossing the international date line from a tropical storm to a category 5 typhoon in 30 hours with a wind speed rise of 90 knots hurricane marie rapidly deepened from category 1 at 2:00 pm pdt on august 23 to category 5 with sustained winds of 160 mph gusting to 195 mph at 2:00 pm pdt on august 24 the pressure dropping from 988mbar to 918mbar an average of 2.916 millibars per hour during that same period in september 2014 hurricane odile rapidly intensified from a category 1 into a category 4 with pressure dropping to 918 mbar hurricane simon intensified from a tropical storm into a category 4 hurricane in october 2014 typhoon vongfong deepened 30 mbar in 6 hours and 65 mbar in just a day in november 2014 typhoon nuri explosively intensified from a tropical storm to a category 5 super typhoon in 18 hours its pressure had dropped from 975 mbar to 910 mbar in december 2014 typhoon hagupit explosively intensified from a category 3 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon for 12 hours with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 215 km h 130 mph and the central pressure at 905 hpa 26.72 inhg in february 2015 tropical cyclone marcia developed in the coral sea of the queensland coast in australia it was named a category 1 australian scale cyclone by the bureau of meteorology on 18 february and underwent a period of very rapid intensification on 19 february reaching category 4 status the following morning it was upgraded to category 5 status before crossing the coast north of yeppoon queensland meanwhile in the northwest pacific typhoon higos rapidly deepened 45 millibars in 30 hours in late march 2015 typhoon maysak rapidly intensified from a category 2 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon in a day and became the strongest storm before april within the basin in early may typhoon noul also rapidly intensified from a category 2 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon within a similar timeframe with a 45 millibar drop typhoon dolphin rapidly intensified from a category 2 to a category 5 within 24 hours in october 2015 hurricane patricia underwent explosive intensification the storm reached hurricane status just before 00:00 on october 22 and reached category 4 status 18 hours later patricia further intensified to reach category 5 status the next day and peaked with winds of 215 mph by 12:00 utc on october 23 patricia's winds increased a record 120 mph despite this in the five hours until landfall an eyewall replacement cycle resulted in traumatic weakening winds decreased 65 mph before landfall however with winds of 150 mph patricia still holds the record for the strongest mexican landfall on the pacific side in september 2017 hurricane maria explosively intensified from a category 1 with a pressure of 982 mbar hpa 29.00 inhg to a category 5 with a pressure of 925 mbar hpa 28.23 inhg in under a 24-hour period see also tropical cyclones portal tropical cyclone list of the most intense tropical cyclones bomb meteorology annular tropical cyclone
