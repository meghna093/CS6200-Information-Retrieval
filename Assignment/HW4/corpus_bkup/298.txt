the indigenous people of the caribbean at the time of european contact in the late 15th century they were the principal inhabitants of most of cuba trinidad jamaica hispaniola haiti and the dominican republic and puerto rico in the greater antilles the northern lesser antilles and the bahamas they were known as the lucayans they spoke the tano language an arawakan language the ancestors of the tano entered the caribbean from south america and their culture is closely linked to that of mesoamericans 1 at the time of contact the tano were divided into three broad groups known as the western tano jamaica most of cuba and the bahamas the classic tano hispaniola and puerto rico and the eastern tano northern lesser antilles tano groups were in conflict with the caribs of the southern lesser antilles at the time of columbus arrival in 1492 there were five tano chiefdoms and territories on hispaniola each led by a principal cacique chieftain to whom tribute was paid ayiti land of high mountains was the indigenous tano name for the island of hispaniola which on the western side has retained its name as hati in french cuba the largest island of the antilles was originally divided into 29 chiefdoms most of the native settlements later became the site of spanish colonial cities retaining the original tano names including havana bataban camagey baracoa and bayamo 2 the name cuba comes from the tano language although the exact meaning of the name is unclear it can be translated as where fertile land is abundant cubao or a great place coabana puerto rico was also divided into chiefdoms as the hereditary head chief of tano nation the cacique received significant tribute at the time of the spanish conquest the largest tano population centers may have had more than 3,000 people each 3 the tano were historically enemies of the neighboring carib nations a different group which also had its origins in south america and lived mainly in the lesser antilles 4 the relationship between the rival groups has been the subject of many studies for much of the 15th century the tano tribe was being driven to the northeast in the caribbean because of raids by the carib women were taken as captives resulting in many carib women speaking tano 5 the spaniards who arrived in the bahamas cuba and hispaniola in 1492 and later in puerto rico did not bring women on their first expeditions since the arrival of the conquistadores taino women were stolen and some became commodities for spaniards to trade the rape of tano women in hispaniola by the spanish was common resulting in mestizo children 6]        [65 tano heritage in modern times groups of people currently identify as tano most notably among the puerto ricans and dominicans both on the islands and on united states mainland some scholars such as jalil sued badillo an ethnohistorian at the university of puerto rico assert that although the official spanish histories speak of the disappearance of the tanos many survivors left descendants usually by intermarrying with other ethnic groups recent research revealed a high percentage of mixed or tri-racial ancestry in puerto rico and the dominican republic those claiming tano ancestry also have spanish ancestry or african ancestry and often both frank moya pons a dominican historian documented that spanish colonists intermarried with tano women over time some of their mixed descendants intermarried with africans creating a tri-racial creole culture 1514 census records reveal that 40 of spanish men on the island of hispaniola had tano wives ethnohistorian lynne guitar writes that the tano were declared extinct in spanish documents as early as the 16th century however individual tanos continued to appear in wills and legal records for several decades after the arrival of the spaniards 66 evidence suggests that some tano men and african women inter-married and lived in relatively isolated maroon communities in the interior of the islands where they evolved into a hybrid rural or campesino population with little or no interference from the spanish authorities scholars also note that contemporary rural dominicans retain tano linguistic features agricultural practices food ways medicine fishing practices technology architecture oral history and religious views however these cultural traits are often looked down upon by urbanites as backwards 66 sixteen autosomal studies of peoples in the spanish-speaking caribbean and its diaspora mostly puerto ricans have shown that between 10-20 of their dna is indigenous with some individuals having slightly higher scores and others having lower scores or no indigenous dna at all 67 a recent study of a population in eastern puerto rico where the majority of persons tested claimed tano ancestry and pedigree showed that they had 61 mtdna distant maternal ancestry and 0 y-chromosome dna distant paternal ancestry demonstrating as expected that this is a hybrid creole population 68 groups such as the jatibonicu taino tribal nation of boriken puerto rico 1970 the tano nation of the antilles n y c 1993 united confederation of tano people n y c 1998 and el pueblo guatu ma-cu a borikn puerto rico 2000 have been established to foster tano culture citation needed tano activists have created two unique writing scripts the scripts are used to write spanish not a retained language from pre-columbian ancestors 69 the organization guaka-k teaches and uses their script among their own members the lgtk liga guaka tana-k has promoted teaching their script among
