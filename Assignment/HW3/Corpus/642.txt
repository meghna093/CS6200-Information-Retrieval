pascal unit  wikipedia pascal a pressure gauge reading in psi red scale and kpa black scale unit information unit system si derived unit unit of pressure or stress symbol pa named after blaise pascal unit conversions 1 pa in is equal to si base units kgm1s2 us customary units 1.450  10-4 psi atmosphere 9.869  10-6 atm bar 10-5 bar the pascal symbol pa is the si derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure stress young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength it is defined as one newton per square metre 1 it is named after the french polymath blaise pascal common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal 1 hpa  100 pa which is equal to one millibar and the kilopascal 1 kpa  1000 pa which is equal to one centibar the unit of measurement called standard atmosphere atm is defined as 101325 pa and approximates to the average pressure at sea-level at the latitude 45 n 2 meteorological reports typically state atmospheric pressure in millibars etymology the unit is named after blaise pascal noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics and experiments with a barometer the name pascal was adopted for the si unit newton per square metre n m2 by the 14th general conference on weights and measures in 1971.        [19 many countries also use the millibar or hectopascal to give aviation altimeter settings in practically all other fields the kilopascal 1000 pascals is used instead citation needed see also centimetre of water metric prefix orders of magnitude pressure pascal's law references external links v t e si units authority international system of units bipm base units ampere candela kelvin kilogram metre mole second derived units with special names becquerel coulomb degree celsius farad gray henry hertz joule katal lumen lux newton ohm pascal radian siemens sievert steradian tesla volt watt weber other accepted units astronomical unit bar dalton day decibel degree of arc electronvolt hectare hour litre minute minute of arc neper second of arc tonne atomic units natural units see also conversion of units metric prefixes proposed redefinitions systems of measurement book category
