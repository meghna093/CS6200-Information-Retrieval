slow-motion lightning video captured at 6,200 frames per second lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs during a thunderstorm this discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud called intra-cloud lightning or ic between two clouds cc lightning or between a cloud and the ground cg lightning the charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a flash a lightning flash can also be a strike if it involves an object on the ground lightning creates light in the form of black body radiation from the very hot plasma created by the electron flow and sound in the form of thunder lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash lightning electrification the main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly updraft and temperatures range from 15 to 25 celsius the details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification the main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly updraft and temperatures range from 15 to 25 celsius see figure to the right at that place the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets small water droplets below freezing small ice crystals and graupel soft hail the updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward at the same time the graupel which is considerably larger and denser tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air 1 when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel soft hail the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged the differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel soft hail the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged see figure to the left the updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud the larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm 1 the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged the result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged 1 the upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals and positive charge in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base this part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil while this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm updrafts and downdrafts in addition there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures 1 general considerations play media four-second video of a lightning strike island in the sky canyonlands national park utah united states on earth the lightning frequency is approximately 4050 times a second or nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year                         [124 similarly a bolt from the blue refers to something totally unexpected some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power such as the people's action party in singapore the british union of fascists during the 1930s and the national states rights party in the united states during the 1950s 125 the schutzstaffel the paramilitary wing of the nazi party used the sig rune in their logo which symbolizes lightning the german word blitzkrieg which means lightning war was a major offensive strategy of the german army during world war ii in french and italian the expression for love at first sight is coup de foudre and colpo di fulmine respectively which literally translated means lightning strike some european languages have a separate word for lightning which strikes the ground as opposed to lightning in general often it is a cognate of the english word rays the name of new zealand's most celebrated thoroughbred horse phar lap derives from the shared zhuang and thai word for lightning 126 the bolt of lightning in heraldry is called a thunderbolt and is shown as a zigzag with non-pointed ends this symbol usually represents power and speed the lightning bolt is used to represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered telegraphs and radios it was a commonly used motif in art deco design especially the zig-zag art deco design of the late 1920s 127 the lightning bolt is a common insignia for military communications units throughout the world a lightning bolt is also the nato symbol for a signal asset the unicode symbol for lightning is  u+2607 see also a lightning bolt at petrified forest national park usa environment portal atmospheric convection dark
