e a full-size model of the earth observation satellite ers 2 in context of spaceflight a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earth's moon in 1957 the soviet union launched the world's first artificial satellite sputnik 1 since then about 6,600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched according to a 2013 estimate 3,600 remained in orbit 1 of those about 1,000 were operational 2 while the rest have lived out their useful lives and became space debris approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-earth orbit 50 are in medium-earth orbit at 20,000 km and the rest are in geostationary orbit at 36,000 km 3 a few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn a few asteroids 4 and the sun satellites are used for many purposes common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and space telescopes space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known overlapping classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbit a launch vehicle is a rocket that throws a satellite into orbit usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform or aboard a plane see air launch to orbit satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks such as power generation thermal control telemetry attitude control and orbit control history early conceptions newton's cannonball presented as a thought experiment in a treatise of the system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon 5]               skcube started 23.06.2017 with indian launche vehicle pslv-xl     [110 also it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively citation needed satellite services satellite crop monitoring satellite internet access satellite
