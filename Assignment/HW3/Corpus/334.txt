september 16 it traversed steadily westward with the southern portion of the wave axis moving across northern south america on september 26 the wave entered the eastern pacific ocean near panama and slowly organized a weak low-level trough extended from the caribbean sea to south of mexico disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents on october 3 the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection and began to drift eastward to the south of mexico two days later a low-level circulation formed and midday on october 5 the system developed into tropical depression eighteen-e while located about 250 miles 410 km south-southwest of huatulco in the state of oaxaca 1 with an absence of vertical wind shear the depression drifted just south of due east and steadily organized the system developed banding features and a central dense overcast and early on october 6 the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named pauline while located about 295 miles 475 km south-southeast of salina cruz oaxaca a strong high pressure system eroded the trough over southeastern mexico which turned pauline to the northeast an eye feature developed late on october 6 and early the next day pauline intensified into a hurricane about 265 miles 425 km southeast of salina cruz after turning to the north and northwest 1 pauline rapidly intensified after becoming a

centers for acapulco citizens though some residents were unable to get food and water some residents suspected than the president and his institutional revolutionary party of taking aid supplies for

was aid distributed at the aid centers 51 most of acapulco remained closed for at least a week after the hurricane 51 initially authorities around acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane causing some hotels to charge 40 percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back one airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from mexico city to acapulco most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane 53 donations the governments of oaxaca and guerrero asked unicef for assistance specifically water tanks water pumps and construction material 33 international aid initially focused almost

around ten days after the hurricane struck 20,000 people were still isolated from emergency crews and relief works causing the president to suspect people could begin starving to death helicopters

angeles delivered 2,000 comfort kits containing hygiene supplies and crossword puzzles for children 56 the german red cross also offered assistance 49 diseases the floodwaters from the hurricane combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern mexico leading to a widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases as a result government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the guerrero and oaxaca coasts thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera as a result of the spoiled water health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water in acapulco about two days after the hurricane passed the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30 minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust 34 at least twenty cases of cholera[53 and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported 57 most significantly there were 14,630 cases of malaria in 616 villages in oaxaca due to pauline this represented about 80 of the malaria cases in mexico during 1998.[58 army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes two c-130 hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane
