scales according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin s they are located in only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones but some alternative scales also exist such as accumulated cyclone energy the power dissipation index the integrated kinetic energy index and the hurricane severity index tropical cyclones that develop in the northern hemisphere are officially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the north atlantic ocean or the north-eastern pacific ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms should a system intensify further and become a hurricane then it will be classified on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period in the western pacific the typhoon committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period the india meteorological department's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the north indian ocean and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds tropical cyclones that develop in the southern hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on off two scales which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which is used to classify systems within the australian or south pacific tropical cyclone basins the scale used to classify systems in the south-west indian ocean and is adapted by meteo france for use in various french territories including new caledonia and french polynesia the definition of sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10 m 33 ft however the saffirsimpson hurricane scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period at 10 m 33 ft above the surface the scale used by rsmc new delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period and the australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval these make direct comparisons between basins difficult within all basins tropical cyclones are named when the sustained winds hit 35 kn 40 mph 65 km h background this section does not cite any sources please

are defined as being warm cored non-frontal synoptic cyclones that develop over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation they are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked by the world meteorological organisation's regional specialized meteorological centers on one of five tropical cyclone scales the scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in with for example the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale and the australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the western hemisphere all of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds which are either observed measured or estimated using various techniques over a period between one and ten minutes atlantic eastern and central pacific saffirsimpson scale category wind speeds five 70 m s 137 knots 157 mph 252 km h four 5870 m s 113136 knots 130156 mph 209251 km h three 5058 m s 96112 knots 111129 mph 178208 km h two 4349 m s 8395 knots 96110 mph 154177 km h one 3342 m s 6482 knots 7495 mph 119153 km h related classifications tropical storm 1832 m s 3463 knots 3973 mph 63118 km h tropical depression 17 m s 33 knots 38 mph 62 km h main article saffirsimpson scale tropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere to the east of the anti-meridian are officially monitored by either the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane center 1 within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored non-frontal synoptic disturbance that develops over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre 1 the region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones 1 once either of these classifications are met then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33 kn 38 mph 62 km h 1 however if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone 1 should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 3463 kn 3973 mph 63118 km h then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name 1 should the tropical system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured as greater than 64 kn 74 mph 119 km h then it will be called a hurricane and classified on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale 1 the lowest classification on the sshws is a category 1 hurricane which has winds of between 6482 kn 7495 mph 119153 km h 1]       [19 for systems below tropical cyclone strength there are various terms used including tropical disturbance tropical low and tropical depression 17 a tropical disturbance is defined as being a non  frontal system of synoptic scale originating over the tropics with persistent enhanced convection and or some indication of a circulation 17 a tropical depression or tropical low is a disturbance with a defined circulation where the central position can be estimated and the maximum 10-minute average wind speed is less than 34 kn 39 mph 63 km h near the centre 17 the fms numbers these systems when they have a potential to develop into a tropical cyclone or persist to cause significant impact to life and property within its area of responsibility and have been analysed for the previous 24 hours 17 the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale was introduced by the bom ahead of the 198990 cyclone season the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government 8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in these basins the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones 9 alternative scales there are other scales that are not officially used by any of the regional specialized meteorological centres or the tropical cyclone warning centres however they are used by other organizations such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration an example of such scale is the integrated kinetic energy index which measures the destructive potential of the storm surge it works on a scale that ranges from one to six with six having the highest destructive potential 20 accumulated cyclone energy ace is used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and other agencies to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons 21 it is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm wind speed 35 knots or higher at six-hour intervals 21 the numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable the unit of ace is 104 kn2 and for use as an index the unit is assumed 21 as well as being squared for ace wind speed can also be cubed which is referred to as the power dissipation index pdi 22 the hurricane severity index hsi is another scale used and rates the severity of all types of tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields 23 the hsi is a 0 to 50 point scale allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size 23 points are awarded on a sliding scale with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields 23 comparisons across basins the terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region
