forming out of a tropical disturbance on november 1 1991 several hundred kilometers north-northeast of palau the depression that would become thelma tracked generally westward after turning southwestward in response to a cold front the system intensified into a tropical storm on november 4 as it approached the philippines hours before moving over the visayas thelma attained its peak intensity with estimated ten-minute sustained winds of 75 km h 45 mph and a barometric pressure of 992 mbar hpa 29.29 inhg despite moving over land the system weakened only slightly emerging over the south china sea on november 6 while retaining gale-force winds thelma ultimately succumbed to wind shear and degraded to a tropical depression on november 8 the depression made landfall in southern vietnam before dissipating hours later while passing over the philippines thelma's interaction with the high terrain of some of the islands resulted in torrential rainfall through a process known as orographic lift much of the visayas received 150 mm 6 in of rain however on leyte island there was a localized downpour that brought totals to 580.5 mm 22.85 in with the majority of this falling in a three-hour span an unprecedented flash flood took place on the island much of the land had been deforestated or poorly cultivated and was unable to absorb most of the rain creating a large runoff this water overwhelmed the anilaomalbasag watershed and rushed downstream ormoc city located past where the anilao and malbasag rivers converge suffered the brunt of the flood in just three hours the city was devastated with thousands of homes damaged or destroyed a total of 4,922 people were killed in the city alone with 2,300 perishing along the riverbank outside of ormoc city 159 people were killed

in philippine history surpassing a storm in 1867 that killed 1,800,       [22 additionally 3,020 people were injured 11 the majority of those missing were likely swept out to sea by the flood and presumed dead 12 two days after the storm several bodies of those swept out to sea washed back ashore 23 officials stated that the death toll could have been in the tens of thousands had the flood occurred at night rather than in the middle of the day 12 aftermath it looked like it was a nazi death camp children and old people were piled on top of each other  cebu provincial governor lito

deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts relief efforts in ormoc city were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel amateur radio reports stated that an ac-130 was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked 13 relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region 19 by november 11 approximately 8,300 families had been rescued and another 7,521 were evacuated from affected regions 13 supply distribution centers were established in ormoc providing residents with food water and materials by november 11.[13 people were given a can of sardines and 1 kg 2.2 lb of rice at these centers 24 these centers were only able to operate in daylight though due to a lack of fuel and transportation water was supplied in limited quantities from cebu medical and sanitation teams were deployed throughout the province with many coming from surrounding areas 13 residents searched through debris for lumber to construct makeshift coffins while others stacked bodies to be picked up by wheelbarrows or trucks 19 officials had difficulty determining how to best deal with mass casualties as bodies lay across the ormoc region many were found in the coastal barangays of linao camp downes and bantigue as well as the ormoc pier 22 in order to prevent the spread of disease mass graves were dug with 700 bodies buried on november 8 dump trucks were used to transport the dead to these sites as quickly as possible 25 as decomposition set in residents stated that the putrid smell was unbearable  even months after the storm bodies were occasionally discovered some found in drainage systems 22 by november 10 four navy vessels were searching debris in the waters near ormoc for bodies 16 were recovered that day with more believed to be submerged in the bay 26 roads surrounding the city were finally cleared by november 12 however electricity remained out with the deployment

approximately 2,300 people were killed was declared uninhabitable by officials however residents still returned to the area due to a need for land eventually signs that used to warn people not to stay on the islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there a resettlement community was constructed months later with plans to house 912 of the 2,668 families that needed to be moved from the area those that were not moved were left on isle verde despite orders not to stay there 20 another resettlement project for 700 families was planned at the cost of 1 million 13 the sheer magnitude of the flood event in the anilaomalbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris raising their water levels and widening their banks in a post-disaster assessment in october 1992 it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future 18 it was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas however by the time of the report people had already begun repopulating the area as a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed reforestation contoured farming and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater 27 long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in ormoc 18 in 1993 following a request by the philippine government the japan international cooperation agency conducted as study on flood control for ormoc and other cities across the country in 1998 a 800 million 20.6 million usd construction project for flood mitigation was approved and later completed in 2001 that year
