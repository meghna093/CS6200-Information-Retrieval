precipitation  wikipediafor other uses see precipitation disambiguation countries by average annual precipitation in meteorology precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity 2 the main forms of precipitation include drizzle rain sleet snow graupel and hail precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor so that the water condenses and precipitates thus fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate two processes possibly acting together can lead to air becoming saturated cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud short intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called showers 3 moisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-freezing air at the surface may be condensed into clouds and rain this process is typically active when freezing rain is occurring a stationary front is often present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the foci for forcing and rising air provided necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content the moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds namely stratus and cumulonimbus eventually the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form raindrops and descend toward the earth where they will freeze on contact with exposed objects where relatively warm water bodies are present for example due to water evaporation from lakes lake-effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy thundersnow is possible within a cyclone's comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands in mountainous areas heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation on the leeward side of mountains desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating the movement of the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone brings rainy seasons to savannah climes precipitation is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing the fresh water on the planet approximately 505,000 cubic kilometres 121,000 cu mi of water falls as precipitation each year 398,000 cubic kilometres 95,000 cu mi of it over the oceans and 107,000 cubic kilometres 26,000 cu mi over land 4 given the earth's surface area that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres 39 in but over land it is only 715 millimetres 28.1 in climate classification systems such as the kppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies e g when

that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres 39 in mechanisms of producing precipitation include convective stratiform 6 and orographic rainfall 7 convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation 8 while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation 9 precipitation can be divided into three categories based on whether it falls as liquid water liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface or ice mixtures of different types of precipitation including types in different categories can fall simultaneously liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle rain or drizzle that freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass is called freezing rain or freezing drizzle frozen forms of precipitation include snow ice needles ice pellets hail and graupel 10 how the air becomes saturated cooling air to its dew point late-summer rainstorm in denmark lenticular cloud forming due to mountains over wyoming the dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated and unless super-saturation occurs condenses to water 11 water vapour normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds an elevated portion of a frontal zone forces broad areas of lift which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass it can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions 12 there are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point adiabatic cooling conductive cooling radiational cooling and evaporative cooling adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands 13 the air can rise due to convection large-scale atmospheric motions or a physical barrier such as a mountain orographic lift conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface 14 usually by being blown from one surface to another for example from a liquid water surface to colder land radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation either by the air or by the surface underneath 15 evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature or until it reaches saturation 16 adding moisture to the air the main ways water vapour is added to the air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion 8 precipitation or virga falling from above 17 daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land 18 transpiration from plants 19 cool or dry air moving over warmer water 20 and lifting air over mountains 21 formation main article water cycle condensation and coalescence are important parts of the water cycle raindrops coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets or when water droplets freeze onto an ice crystal which is known as the bergeron process the fall rate of very small droplets is negligible hence clouds do not fall out of the sky precipitation will only occur when these coalesce into larger drops when air turbulence occurs water droplets collide producing larger droplets as these larger water droplets descend coalescence continues so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain 22 raindrops have sizes ranging from 0.1 millimetres 0.0039 in to 9 millimetres 0.35 in mean diameter above which they tend to break up smaller drops are called cloud droplets and their shape is spherical as a raindrop increases in size its shape becomes more oblate with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow contrary to the cartoon pictures of raindrops their shape does not resemble a teardrop 23 intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related i e high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration 24]    [80 if a network is not available in the area where one lives the nearest local weather office will likely be interested in the measurement 81 hydrometeor definition a concept used in precipitation measurement is the hydrometeor bits of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors formations due to condensation such as clouds haze fog and mist are composed of hydrometeors all precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition including virga which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground particles blown from the earth's surface by wind such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray are also hydrometeors 82 satellite estimates although surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation there are many areas in which their use is not feasible this includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas in other cases social technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations as a result the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations 83 satellite sensors work by remotely sensing precipitationrecording various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that theory and practice show are related to the occurrence and intensity of precipitation the sensors are almost exclusively passive recording what they see similar to a camera in contrast to active sensors radar lidar that send out a signal and detect its impact on the area being observed satellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories thermal infrared ir sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops due to the typical structure of the atmosphere cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes further cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds various mathematical schemes or algorithms use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the ir data 84 the second category of sensor channels is in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum the frequencies in use range from about 10 gigahertz to a few hundred ghz channels up to about 37 ghz primarily provide information on the liquid hydrometeors rain and drizzle in the lower parts of clouds with larger amounts of liquid emitting higher amounts of microwave radiant energy channels above 37 ghz display emission signals but are dominated by the action of solid hydrometeors snow graupel etc  to scatter microwave radiant energy satellites such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the global precipitation measurement gpm mission employ microwave sensors to form precipitation estimates additional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels additional ir channels water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals however most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources 85 satellite data sets the ir estimates have rather low skill at short time and space scales but are available very frequently 15 minutes or more often from satellites in geosynchronous earth orbit ir works best in cases of deep vigorous convectionsuch as the tropicsand becomes progressively less useful in areas where stratiform layered precipitation dominates especially in mid and high-latitude regions the more-direct physical connection between hydrometeors and microwave channels gives the microwave estimates greater skill on short time and space scales than is true for ir however microwave sensors fly only on low earth orbit satellites and there are few enough of them that the average time between observations exceeds three hours this several-hour interval is insufficient to adequately document precipitation because of the transient nature of most precipitation systems as well as the inability of a single satellite to appropriately capture the typical daily cycle of precipitation at a given location since the late 1990s several algorithms have been developed to combine precipitation data from multiple satellites sensors seeking to emphasize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets the goal is to provide best estimates of precipitation on a uniform time space grid usually for as much of the globe as possible in some cases the long-term homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized which is the climate data record standard in other cases the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite estimate which is the high resolution precipitation product approach in either case of course the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable one key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates the difficulties in using gauge data are that 1 their availability is limited as noted above and 2 the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission assembly processing and quality control thus precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates as a result while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the true precipitation they are generally not suited for real or near-real-time applications the work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different formats time space grids periods of record and regions of coverage input datasets and analysis procedures as well as many different forms of dataset version designators 86 in many cases one of the modern multi-satellite data sets is the best choice for general use return period see also 100-year flood the likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration is called the return period or frequency 87 the intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration from charts based on historic data for the location 88 the term 1 in 10 year storm describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10 years so it has a 10 percent likelihood any given year the rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year the term 1 in 100 year storm describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century so has a 1 percent likelihood in any given year the rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10 year event as with all probability events it is possible though unlikely to have two 1 in 100 year storms in a single year 89 role in kppen climate classification

monsoon tropical savanna humid subtropical humid continental oceanic climate mediterranean climate steppe subarctic climate tundra polar ice cap and desert rain forests are characterized by high rainfall with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 and 2,000 mm 69 and 79 in 91 a tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes with rainfall between 750 and 1,270 mm 30 and 50 in a year they are widespread on africa and are also found in india the northern parts of south america malaysia and australia 92 the humid subtropical climate zone is where winter rainfall and sometimes snowfall is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones 93 humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents roughly between latitudes 20 and 40 degrees away from the equator 94 an oceanic or maritime climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents bordering cool oceans as well as southeastern australia and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round 95 the mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the mediterranean basin parts of western north america parts of western and south australia in southwestern south africa and in parts of central chile the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool wet winters 96 a steppe is a dry grassland 97 subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation 98 effect on agriculture rainfall estimates for southern japan and the surrounding region from july 20 to 27 2009 precipitation especially rain has a dramatic effect on agriculture all plants need at least some water to survive therefore rain being the most effective means of watering is important to agriculture while a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants too much or too little rainfall can be harmful even devastating to crops drought can kill crops and increase erosion 99 while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth 100 plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive for example certain cacti require small amounts of water 101 while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive in areas with wet and dry seasons soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season 24 animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season as the crops have yet to mature 102 developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest which occurs late in the wet season 65 changes due to global warming see also global warming increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which leads to more precipitation precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30n from 1900 to 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century although trends have varied widely by region and over time eastern portions of north and south america northern europe and northern and central asia have become wetter the sahel the mediterranean southern africa and parts of southern asia have become drier there has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughtsespecially in the tropics and subtropics changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid and high-latitude waters implying more precipitation along with increased salinity in lower latitudes implying less precipitation more evaporation or both over the contiguous united states total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1 per century since 1900 with the greatest increases within the east north central climate region 11.6 per century and the south 11.1 hawaii was the only region to show a decrease 9.25 103 changes due to urban heat island see also urban heat island image of atlanta georgia showing temperature distribution with hot areas appearing white the urban heat island warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 c 1.1 to 10.1 f above surrounding suburbs and rural areas this extra heat leads to greater upward motion which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48 and 116 partly as a result of this warming monthly rainfall is about 28 greater between 32 to 64 kilometres 20 to 40 mi downwind of cities compared with upwind 104 some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51 105 forecasting main articles probability of precipitation and quantitative precipitation forecast example of a five-day rainfall forecast from the hydrometeorological prediction center the quantitative precipitation forecast abbreviated qpf is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area 106 a qpf will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a qpf valid period precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000 0600 1200 and 1800 gmt terrain is considered in qpfs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail 107 starting in the mid to late 1990s qpfs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the united states 108 forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere which decreases with height 109 qpf can be generated on a quantitative forecasting amounts or a qualitative forecasting the probability of a specific amount basis 110 radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within six to seven hours of the time of the radar image the forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements weather radar estimates or a combination of both various skill
