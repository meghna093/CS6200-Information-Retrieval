kennedy space center ksc is one of ten national aeronautics and space administration field centers since december 1968 kennedy space center has been nasa's primary launch center of human spaceflight launch operations for the apollo skylab and space shuttle programs were carried out from kennedy space center launch complex 39 and managed by ksc 2 located on the east coast of florida ksc is adjacent to cape canaveral air force station ccafs the management of the two entities work very closely together share resources and even own facilities on each other's property though the first apollo flights and all project mercury and project gemini flights took off from ccafs the launches were managed by ksc and its previous organization the launch operations directorate 3]             [56 this makes extensive lightning protection and detection systems necessary to protect employees structures and spacecraft on launch pads 57 on november 14 1969 apollo 12 was struck by lightning just after lift-off from pad 39a but the flight continued safely the most powerful lightning strike recorded at ksc occurred at lc-39b on august 25 2006 while shuttle atlantis was being prepared for sts-115 nasa managers were initially concerned that the lightning strike caused damage to atlantis but none was found 58 on september 7 2004 hurricane frances directly hit the area with sustained winds of 70 miles per hour 110 km h and gusts up to 94 miles per hour 151 km h the most damaging storm to date the vehicle assembly building lost 1,000 exterior panels each 3.9 feet 1.2 m x 9.8 feet 3.0 m in size this exposed 39,800 sq ft 3,700 m2 of the building to the elements damage occurred to the south and east sides of the vab the shuttle's thermal protection system facility suffered extensive damage the roof was partially torn off and the interior suffered water damage several rockets on display in the center were toppled 59 further damage to ksc was caused by hurricane wilma in october 2005 ksc directors dr kurt debus first director of ksc since ksc's formation ten nasa officials have served as directors including three former astronauts crippen bridges and cabana labor force when ksc separated from marshall space flight center in july 1962 it took 375 employees with it in may 1965 ksc had 7,000 employees and contractors move from rented space in cocoa beach to the new merritt island facilities the peak number of persons working on center was 26,000 in 1968 3,000 were civil servants in 1970 president nixon announced intent to reduce cost of space operations and major cuts occurred at ksc by 1974 ksc's workforce was down to 10,000 employees 2,408 civil servants 6 a total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011 approximately 2,100 are employees of the federal government the rest are contractors 70 the average annual salary for an on-site worker in 2008 was 77,235.[71 the end of the space shuttle program in 2011 preceded by the cancellation of constellation program in 2010 produced a significant downsizing of the ksc workforce similar to that experienced at the end of the apollo program in 1972 as part of this downsizing 6,000 contractors lost their jobs at the center during 2010 and 2011.[72 see also florida portal government of the united states portal spaceflight portal air force space  missile museum astronaut beach house mobile
