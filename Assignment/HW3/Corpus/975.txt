degree angle  wikipedia degree unit system non-si accepted unit unit of angle symbol      [13 furthermore it is divisible by every number from 1 to 10 except 7.[note 2 this property has many useful applications such as dividing the world into 24 time zones each of which is nominally 15 of longitude to correlate with the established 24-hour day convention finally it may be the case that more than one of these factors has come into play according to that theory the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above subdivisions for many practical purposes a degree is a small enough angle that whole degrees provide sufficient precision when this is not the case as in astronomy or for geographic coordinates latitude and longitude degree measurements may be written using decimal degrees with the degree symbol behind the decimals for example 40.1875 alternatively the traditional sexagesimal unit subdivisions can be used one degree is divided into 60 minutes of arc and one minute into 60 seconds of arc use of degrees-minutes-seconds is also called dms notation these subdivisions also called the arcminute and arcsecond are respectively represented by a single and double prime for example 40.1875  40 11 15 or using quotation mark characters 40 11 15 additional precision can be provided using decimals for the arcseconds component the older system of thirds fourths etc which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision was used by al-kashi and other ancient astronomers but is rarely used today these subdivisions were denoted[citation needed by writing the roman numeral for the number of sixtieths in superscript 1i for a prime minute of arc 1ii for a second 1iii for a third 1iv for a fourth etc hence the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc and the word second also refer to this system citation needed alternative units see also measuring angles a chart to convert between degrees and radians in most mathematical work beyond practical geometry angles are typically measured in radians rather than degrees this is for a variety of reasons for example the trigonometric functions have simpler and more natural properties when their arguments are expressed in radians these considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360 one complete turn 360 is equal to 2 radians so 180 is equal to  radians or equivalently the degree is a mathematical constant 1  180 the turn or revolution full circle full rotation cycle is used in technology and science one turn is equal to 360 with the invention of the metric system based on powers of ten there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal degrees [note 3 called grad or gon where the number in a right angle is equal to 100 gon with 400 gon in a full circle 1  109 gon although that idea was abandoned by napoleon grades continued to be used in several fields and many scientific calculators support them decigrades  14,000 were used with french artillery sights in world war i an angular mil which is most used in military applications has at least three specific variants ranging from 16,400 to 16,000 it is approximately equal to one milliradian c 16,283 a mil measuring 16,000 of a revolution originated in the imperial russian army where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units this may be seen on a lining plane an early device for aiming indirect fire artillery dating from about 1900 in the st petersburg museum of artillery see also compass geographic coordinate system gradian meridian arc square degree square minute square second steradian notes  the divisors of 360 are 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 15 18 20 24 30 36 40 45 60 72 90 120 180 and 360  contrast this with the relatively unwieldy 2520 which is the least common multiple for every number from 1 to 10  these new and decimal degrees
