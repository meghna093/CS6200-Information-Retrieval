attempts to grant the district voting representation including the d c statehood movement and the proposed district of columbia voting rights amendment have been unsuccessful opponents of d c voting rights propose that the founding fathers never intended for district residents to have a vote in congress since the constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states those opposed to making d c a state claim that such a move would destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant senate representation to a single city 195 sister cities
