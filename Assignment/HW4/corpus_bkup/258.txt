upwelling  wikipedia if the wind blows parallel to the coast in the northern hemisphere such as the coast of california where the wind blows south then ekman transport can produce a net movement of surface water 90 to the right this may result in coastal upwelling upwelling is an oceanographic phenomenon that involves wind-driven motion of dense cooler and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface replacing the warmer usually nutrient-depleted surface water the nutrient-rich upwelled water stimulates the growth and reproduction of primary producers such as phytoplankton due to the biomass of phytoplankton and presence of cool water in these regions upwelling zones can be identified by cool sea surface temperatures sst and high concentrations of chlorophyll-a 1]   [7 deep waters are rich in nutrients including nitrate phosphate and silicic acid themselves the result of decomposition of sinking organic matter dead detrital plankton from surface waters when brought to the surface these nutrients are utilized by phytoplankton along with dissolved co2 carbon dioxide and light energy from the sun to produce organic compounds through the process of photosynthesis upwelling regions therefore result in very high levels of primary production the amount of carbon fixed by phytoplankton in comparison to other areas of the ocean they account for about 50 of global marine productivity 8 high primary production propagates up the food chain because phytoplankton are at the base of the oceanic food chain 9 the food chain follows the course of phytoplankton  zooplankton  predatory zooplankton  filter feeders  predatory fish 4  marine birds marine mammals 10 worldwide there are five major coastal currents associated with upwelling areas the canary current off northwest africa the benguela current off southern africa the california current off california and oregon the humboldt current off peru and chile and the somali current off somalia and oman all of these currents support major fisheries the four major eastern boundary currents in which coastal upwelling primarily occurs are the canary current benguela current california current and humboldt current 11 the benguela current is the eastern boundary of the south atlantic subtropical gyre and can be divided into a northern and southern sub-system with upwelling occurring in both areas the subsystems are divided by an area of permanent upwelling off of luderitz which is the strongest upwelling zone in the world the california current system ccs is an eastern boundary current of the north pacific that is also characterized by a north and south split the split in this system occurs at point conception california due to weak upwelling in the south and strong upwelling in the north the canary current is an eastern boundary current of the north atlantic gyre and is also separated due to the presence of the canary islands finally the humboldt current or the peru current flows west along the coast of south america from peru to chile and extends up to 1,000 kilometers offshore 8 these four eastern boundary currents comprise the majority of coastal upwelling zones in the oceans equatorial effects of equatorial upwelling on surface chlorophyll concentrations in the pacific ocean upwelling at the equator is associated with the intertropical convergence zone itcz which actually moves and consequently is often located just north or south of the equator easterly westward trade winds blow from the northeast and southeast and converge along the equator blowing west to form the itcz although there are no coriolis forces present along the equator upwelling still occurs just north and south of the equator this results in a divergence with denser nutrient-rich water being upwelled from below and results in the remarkable fact that the equatorial region in the pacific can be detected from space as a broad line of high phytoplankton concentration 3 southern ocean upwelling in the southern ocean large-scale upwelling is also found in the southern ocean here strong westerly eastward winds blow around antarctica driving a significant flow of water northwards this is actually a type of coastal upwelling since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between south america and the tip of the antarctic peninsula some of this water is drawn up from great depths in many numerical models and observational syntheses the southern ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface shallower wind-driven upwelling is also found in off the west coasts of north and south america northwest and southwest africa and southwest and south australia all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations see coastal upwelling above some models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above the required diffusion coefficients however appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean nonetheless some diffusive upwelling does probably occur other sources local and intermittent upwellings may occur when offshore islands ridges or seamounts cause a deflection of deep currents providing a nutrient rich area in otherwise low productivity ocean areas examples include upwellings around the galapagos islands and the seychelles islands which have major pelagic fisheries 3 upwelling can also occur when a tropical cyclone transits an area usually when moving at speeds of less than 5 mph 8 km h the churning of a cyclone eventually draws up cooler water from lower layers of the ocean this causes the cyclone to weaken artificial upwelling is produced by devices that use ocean wave energy or ocean thermal energy conversion to pump water to the surface ocean wind turbines are also known to produce upwellings 12 ocean wave devices have been shown to produce plankton blooms 13 variations unusually strong winds from the east push warm red surface water towards africa allowing cold blue water to upwell along the sumatran coast upwelling intensity depends on wind strength and seasonal variability as well as the vertical structure of the water variations in the bottom bathymetry and instabilities in the currents in some areas upwelling is a seasonal event leading to periodic bursts of productivity similar to spring blooms in coastal waters wind-induced upwelling is generated by temperature differences between the warm light air above the land and the cooler denser air over the sea in temperate latitudes the temperature contrast is greatly seasonably variable creating periods of strong upwelling in the spring and summer to weak or no upwelling in the winter for example off the coast of oregon there are four or five strong upwelling events separated by periods of little to no upwelling during the six-month season of upwelling in contrast tropical latitudes have a more constant temperature contrast creating constant upwelling throughout the year the peruvian upwelling for instance occurs throughout most of the year resulting in one of the world's largest marine fisheries for sardines and anchovies 4 in anomalous years when the trade winds weaken or reverse the water that is upwelled is much warmer and low in nutrients resulting in a sharp reduction in the biomass and phytoplankton productivity this event is known as the el nino-southern oscillation enso event the peruvian upwelling system is particularly vulnerable to enso events and can cause extreme interannual variability in productivity 4 changes in bathymetry can affect the strength of an upwelling for example a submarine ridge that extends out from the coast will produce more favorable upwelling conditions than neighboring regions upwelling typically begins at such ridges and remains strongest at the ridge even after developing in other locations 4 high productivity since upwelling regions are important sources of marine productivity and they attract hundreds of species throughout the trophic levels the diversity of these systems has been a focal point for marine research while studying the trophic levels and patterns typical of upwelling regions researchers have discovered that upwelling systems exhibit a wasp-waist richness pattern in this type of pattern the high and low trophic levels are well-represented by high species diversity however the intermediate trophic level is only represented by one or two species this trophic layer which consists of small pelagic fish usually makes up about only three to four percent of the species diversity of all fish species present the lower trophic layers are very well-represented with about 500 species of copepods 2500 species of gastropods and 2500 species of crustaceans on average at the apex and near-apex trophic levels there are usually about 100 species of marine mammals and about 50 species of marine birds the vital intermediate trophic species however are small pelagic fish that usually feed on phytoplankton in most upwelling systems these species are either anchovies or sardines and usually only one is present although two or three species may be present occasionally these fish are an important food source for predators such as large pelagic fish marine mammals and marine birds although they are not at the base of the trophic pyramid they are the vital species that connect the entire marine ecosystem and keep the productivity of upwelling zones so high[11 threats to upwelling ecosystems a major threat to both this crucial intermediate trophic level and the entire upwelling trophic ecosystem is the problem of commercial fishing since upwelling regions are the most productive and species rich areas in the world they attract a high number of commercial fishers and fisheries on one hand this is another benefit of the upwelling process as it serves as a viable source of food and income for so many people and nations besides marine animals however just as in any ecosystem the consequences of over-fishing from a population could be detrimental to that population and the ecosystem as a whole in upwelling ecosystems every species present plays a vital role in the functioning of that ecosystem if one species is significantly depleted that will have an effect throughout the rest of the trophic levels for example if a popular prey species is targeted by fisheries fishermen may collect hundreds of thousands of individuals of this species just by casting their nets into the upwelling waters as these fish are depleted the food source for those who preyed on these fish is depleted therefore the predators of the targeted fish will begin to die off and there will not be as many of them to feed the predators above them this system continues throughout the entire food chain resulting in a possible collapse of the ecosystem it is possible that the ecosystem may be restored over time but not all species can recover from events such as these even if the species can adapt there may be a delay in the reconstruction of this upwelling community 11 the possibility of such an ecosystem collapse is the very danger of fisheries in upwelling regions fisheries may target a variety of different species and therefore they are a direct threat to many species in the ecosystem however they pose the highest threat to the intermediate pelagic fish since these fish form the crux of the entire trophic process of upwelling ecosystems they are highly represented throughout the ecosystem even if there is only one species present unfortunately these fish tend to be the most popular targets of fisheries as about 64 percent of their entire catch consists of pelagic fish among those the six main species that usually form the intermediate trophic layer represent over half of the catch 11 during an el nio wind indirectly drives warm water to the south american coast reducing the effects of cold upwelling besides directly causing the collapse of the ecosystem due to their absence this can create problems in the ecosystem through a variety of other methods as well the animals higher in the trophic levels may not completely starve to death and die off but the decreased food supply could still hurt the populations if animals do not get enough food it will decrease their reproductive viability meaning that they will not breed as often or as successfully as usual this can lead to a decreasing population especially in species that do not breed often under normal circumstances or become reproductively mature late in life another problem is that the decrease in the population of a species due to fisheries can lead to a decrease in genetic diversity resulting in a decrease in bio-diversity of a species if the species diversity is decreased significantly this could cause problems for the species in an environment that is so variable and quick-changing they may not be able to adapt which could result in a collapse of the population or ecosystem 11 another threat to the productivity and ecosystems of upwelling regions is el nio-southern oscillation enso system or more specifically el nio events during the normal period and la nia events the easterly trade winds are still strong which continues to drive the process of upwelling however during el nio events trade winds are weaker causing decreased upwelling in the equatorial regions as the divergence of water north and south of the equator is not as strong or as prevalent the coastal upwelling zones diminish as well since they are wind driven systems and the wind is no longer a very strong driving force in these areas as a result global upwelling drastically decreases causing a decrease in productivity as the waters are no longer receiving nutrient-rich water without these nutrients the rest of the trophic pyramid cannot be sustained and the rich upwelling ecosystem will collapse 14 references external links wind driven surface currents upwelling and downwelling animation demonstrates the upwelling process coastal upwelling on the influence of
