tropical climate  wikipedia a tropical climate in the kppen climate classification is a non-arid climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures of at least 18 c 64 f in tropical climates there are often only two seasons a wet season and a dry season tropical climates are frost-free and changes in the solar angle are small in tropical climates temperature remains relatively constant hot throughout the year sub types within the tropical climate zone there are distinct varieties based on precipitation tropical rain forest climate main article tropical rainforest climate all 12 months have average precipitation of at least 60 mm 2.4 in these climates usually occur within 10 latitude of the equator this climate is dominated by the doldrums low-pressure system all year round

states af some of the places with this climate are indeed uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year e g the northwest pacific coast of south and central america from ecuador to costa rica see for instance andagoya colombia but in many cases the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly wettest as at palembang indonesia or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain as at sitiawan malaysia note the term aseasonal refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly or daily temperature throughout the year annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone albeit unrelated to temperature but to water availability whether as rain mist soil or ground water plant response e g phenology animal feeding migration reproduction etc  and human activities plant sowing harvesting hunting fishing etc  are tuned to this seasonality indeed in tropical south america and central america the rainy season and the high water season is called invierno or inverno though it could occur in the northern hemisphere summer likewise the dry season and low water season is called verano or vero and can occur in the northern hemisphere winter tropical monsoon climate main article tropical monsoon climate this type of climate results from the monsoon winds which change direction according to the seasons this climate has a driest month which nearly always occurs at or soon after the winter solstice for that side of the equator with rainfall less than 60 mm but more than 1 25

latitudes but occasionally an inner-tropical location e g san marcos antioquia colombia also qualifies actually the caribbean coast eastward from the gulf of urab on the colombiapanam border to the orinoco river delta on the atlantic ocean about 4,000 km have long dry periods the extreme is the bsh climate see below characterised by very low unreliable precipitation present for instance in extensive areas in the guajira and coro western venezuela the northernmost peninsulas in south america which receive 300 mm total annual precipitation practically all in two or three months this condition extends to the lesser antilles and greater antilles forming the circum-caribbean dry belt the length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland southward at the latitude of the amazon riverwhich flows eastward just south of the equatorial linethe climate is af east from the andes between the dry arid caribbean and the ever-wet amazon are the orinoco river's llanos or savannas from where this climate takes its name sometimes as is used in place of aw if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days this is the case in parts of hawaii northwestern dominican republic monte cristi villa vsquez lupern east africa mombasa kenya sri lanka trincomalee and brazilian northeastern coast recife joo pessoa and natal for instance in most places that have tropical wet and dry climates however the dry season occurs during the time of lower sun and shorter days because of rain shadow effects during the high-sun part of the year exceptions owing to different causes certain places within the tropics do not have a tropical climate such as some desert areas and alpine regions examples southern part of arabian peninsula the sahara desert alpine regions of the tropics mountaintops within the tropics e g mount kenya can be cold however like lowlands in the tropics and unlike cold winter temperate zone regions there is little seasonal variation of temperature intertropical convergence zone intertropical convergence zone vertical velocity at 500 hpa july average in units of pascals per second ascent negative values is equator descent positive values is more diffuse because of the effect of sun angle on climate most areas within the tropics are hot year-round with diurnal variations in temperature exceeding seasonal variations seasonal variations in tropical climate are dominated by changes in precipitation which are in turn largely influenced by the tropical rain belt or intertropical convergence zone itcz a portion of the hadley cell the itcz is shown for july average in the graphic areas of ascending air have heavy rainfall areas of descending air are dry the itcz somewhat follows the solar equator throughout the year but with
