tropical cyclone basins  wikipedia traditionally areas of tropical cyclone formation are divided into seven basins these include the north atlantic ocean the eastern and western parts of the northern pacific ocean the southwestern pacific the southwestern and southeastern indian oceans and the northern indian ocean arabian sea and bay of bengal the western pacific is the most active and the north indian the least active an average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide with 47 reaching hurricane typhoon strength and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones at least of category 3 intensity 1 overview northern hemisphere north atlantic ocean main article atlantic hurricane tracks of all tropical cyclones in the northern atlantic ocean between 1980 and 2005 this region includes the north atlantic ocean the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico tropical cyclone formation here varies widely from year to year ranging from one to over twenty-five per year 6 most atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between june 1 and november 30 the united states national hurricane center nhc monitors the basin and issues reports watches and warnings about tropical weather systems for the atlantic basin as one of the regional specialized meteorological centres for tropical cyclones as defined by the world meteorological organization 7 on average 11 named storms of tropical storm or higher strength occur each season with an average of 6 becoming hurricanes and 2 becoming major hurricanes the climatological peak of activity is around september 10 each season 8 the united states atlantic coast and gulf coast mexico central america the caribbean islands and bermuda are frequently affected by storms in this basin venezuela the 4 provinces of atlantic canada and atlantic macaronesian islands also are occasionally affected many of the more intense atlantic storms are cape verde-type hurricanes which form off the west coast of africa near the cape verde islands occasionally a hurricane that evolves into an extratropical cyclone can reach western europe including hurricane gordon which spread high winds across spain and the british isles in september 2006.   [34 the tropical cyclone cyclone vance in 1999 produced the highest recorded speed winds in an australian town or city at around 267 km h 166 mph 35 south pacific main article south pacific tropical cyclone season tracks of all tropical cyclones in the southwestern pacific ocean between 1980 and 2005 the south pacific ocean basin runs between 160e and 120w with tropical cyclones developing in it officially monitored by the fiji meteorological service and new zealand's metservice 36 tropical cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries to the west of the dateline though during el nios cyclones have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near french polynesia on average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical cyclones south atlantic ocean see also south atlantic tropical cyclone hurricane catarina is currently the only known tropical cyclone in the south atlantic ocean to have actually reached hurricane intensity cyclones rarely form in other tropical ocean areas which are not formally considered tropical cyclone basins tropical depressions and tropical storms occur occasionally in the south atlantic and the only full-blown tropical cyclones on record were 2004's hurricane catarina which made landfall in brazil and 2010's tropical storm anita which formed off the coast of rio grande do sul the south atlantic ocean is not officially classified as a tropical cyclone basin by the world meteorological organization and does not have a designated regional specialized meteorological center rsmc however the brazilian navy hydrographic center has started in 2011 to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in this basin when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km h 40 mph see also regional specialized meteorological centre list of tropical cyclones references
