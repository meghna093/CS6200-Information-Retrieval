is an idealized thermodynamic process that is both adiabatic and reversible 1]     [10 for an isentropic process which by definition is reversible there is no transfer of energy as heat because the process is adiabatic in an irreversible process of transfer of energy as work entropy is produced within the system consequently in order to maintain constant entropy within the system energy must be removed from the system as heat during the process for reversible processes an isentropic transformation is carried out by thermally insulating the system from its surroundings temperature is the thermodynamic conjugate variable to entropy thus the conjugate process would be an isothermal process in which the system is thermally connected to a constant-temperature heat bath isentropic processes in thermodynamic systems the entropy of a given mass does not change during a process that is internally reversible and adiabatic a process during which the entropy remains constant is called an isentropic process written or 11 some examples of theoretically isentropic thermodynamic devices are pumps gas compressors turbines nozzles and diffusers isentropic efficiencies of steady-flow devices in thermodynamic systems most steady-flow devices operate under adiabatic conditions and the ideal process for these devices is the isentropic process the parameter that describes how efficiently a device approximates a corresponding isentropic device is called isentropic or adiabatic efficiency 12 isentropic efficiency of turbines isentropic efficiency of compressors isentropic efficiency of nozzles for all the above equations isentropic devices in thermodynamic cycles ideal rankine cycle 1->2 isentropic compression in a pump ideal rankine cycle 3->4 isentropic

isentropic expansion in a turbine ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle 1->2 isentropic compression in a compressor note the isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles real cycles have inherent losses due to compressor and turbine inefficiencies and the second law of thermodynamics real systems are not truly isentropic but isentropic behavior is an adequate approximation for many calculation purposes isentropic flow in fluid dynamics an isentropic flow is a fluid flow that is both adiabatic and reversible that is no heat is added to the flow and no energy transformations occur due to friction or dissipative effects for an isentropic flow of a perfect gas several relations can be derived to define the pressure density and temperature along a streamline note that energy can be exchanged with the flow in an isentropic transformation as long as it doesn't happen as heat exchange an example of such an exchange would be an isentropic expansion or compression that entails work done on or by the flow for an isentropic flow entropy density can vary between different streamlines if the entropy density is the same everywhere then the flow is said to be homentropic derivation of the isentropic relations for a closed system the total change in energy of a system is the sum of the work done and the heat added the reversible work done on a system by changing the volume is where is the pressure and is the volume the change in enthalpy   is given by then for a process that is both reversible and adiabatic i e no heat transfer occurs and so all reversible adiabatic processes are isentropic this leads to two important observations next a great deal can be computed for isentropic processes of an ideal gas for any transformation of an ideal gas it is always true that using the general results derived above for and then so for an ideal gas the heat capacity ratio can be written as for an ideal gas is constant hence on integrating the above equation assuming a perfect gas we get using the equation of state for an ideal gas also for constant per mole thus for isentropic processes with an ideal gas table of isentropic relations for an
