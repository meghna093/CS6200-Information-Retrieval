electronic game  wikipediathis article is about the game form for the magazine see electronic games an electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play video game is the most common form today and for this reason the two terms are often mistakenly used synonymously other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games standalone systems e g pinball slot machines or electro-mechanical arcade games and exclusively non-visual products e g audio games teletype games main article text-based game the earliest form of computer game to achieve any degree of mainstream use was the text-based teletype game teletype games lack video display screens and instead present the game to the player by printing a series of characters on paper which the player reads as it emerges from the platen practically this means that each action taken will require a line of paper and thus a hard-copy record of the game remains after it has been played this naturally tends to reduce the size of the gaming universe or alternatively to require a great amount of paper as computer screens became standard during the rise of the third generation computer text-based command line-driven language parsing teletype games transitioned into visual interactive fiction allowing for greater depth of gameplay and reduced paper requirements this transition was accompanied by a simultaneous shift from the mainframe environment to the personal computer examples of text-based teletype games include the oregon trail 1971  the earliest versions trek73 1973 dungeon 1975 super star trek 1975 adventure 1976  the earliest versions zork 1977  the earliest versions electronic handhelds main article handheld electronic game the earliest form of dedicated console handheld electronic games are characterized by their size and portability used to play interactive games handheld electronic games are often miniaturized versions of video games the controls display and speakers are all part of a single unit and rather than a general-purpose screen made up of a grid of small pixels they usually have custom displays designed to play one game this simplicity means they can be made as small as a digital watch which they sometimes are the visual output of these games can range from a few small light bulbs or led lights to calculator-like alphanumerical screens later these were mostly displaced by liquid crystal and vacuum fluorescent display screens with detailed images and in the case of vfd games color handhelds were at their most popular from the late 1970s into the early 1990s they are both the precursors to and inexpensive alternatives to the handheld game console examples of handheld electronic games include mattel auto race 1976 simon 1978 merlin 1978 game  watch 1979 bandai lcd solarpower 1982 entex adventure vision 1982 lights out 1995 pinball machines and similar devices main article pinball  solid-state era since the introduction of electromechanics to the pinball machine in 1933's contact pinball has become increasingly dependent on electronics as a means to keep score on the backglass and to provide quick impulses on the playfield as with bumpers and flippers for exciting gameplay unlike games with electronic visual displays pinball has retained a physical display that is viewed on a table through glass similar forms of game such as pachinko have also become increasingly dependent on electronics in modern times examples of pinball games include the addams family 1991 indiana jones the pinball adventure 1993 star trek the next generation 1993 list of pinball machines redemption games and merchandisers main article redemption game redemption games such as skee ball have been around since the days of the carnival game  well earlier than the development of the electronic game however with modern advances many of these games have been re-worked to employ electronic scoring and other game mechanics the use of electronic scoring mechanisms has allowed carnival or arcade attendants to take a more passive role simply exchanging prizes for electronically dispensed coupons and occasionally emptying out the coin boxes or banknote acceptors of the more popular games merchandisers such as the claw crane are more recent electronic games in which the player must accomplish a seemingly simple task e g remotely controlling a mechanical arm with sufficient ability to earn a reward examples of redemption games include whac-a-mole 1976 skee ball  modern electric versions examples or merchandisers include claw crane 1980 slot machines main article slot machine the slot machine is a casino gambling machine with three or more reels which spin when a button is

modern machines still have a legacy lever in addition to the button on the front slot machines include a currency detector that validates the coin or money inserted to play the machine pays off based on patterns of symbols visible on the front of the machine when it stops modern computer technology has resulted in many variations on the slot machine concept audio games main article audio game an audio game is a game played on an electronic device such asbut not limited toa personal computer it is similar to a video game save that the only feedback device is audible rather than visual audio

and integrated circuits in the past coin-operated arcade video games generally used custom per-game hardware often with multiple cpus highly specialized sound and graphics chips and or boards and the latest in computer graphics display technology recent arcade game hardware is often based on modified video game console hardware or high end pc components arcade games may feature specialized ambiance or control accessories including fully enclosed dynamic cabinets with force feedback controls dedicated lightguns rear-projection displays reproductions of car or plane cockpits and even motorcycle or horse-shaped controllers or even highly dedicated controllers such as dancing mats and fishing rods these accessories are usually what set modern arcade games apart from pc or console games and they provide an experience that some gamers consider more immersing and realistic examples of arcade games include galaxy game 1971 pong 1972 space invaders 1978 galaxian 1979 pac-man 1980

game where an electronic device and or application is an element crucial to the gameplay 2 these games are a catalyst for creating new game mechanics important consequences of this technology are the possible substitution of the gamemaster or person who leads a game for an application or device which can be more fair with less room for bias cheating or favouritism and can be intelligently randomised the possibility of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in games greater randomisation of events possibility of conducting fast and advanced mathematical calculations making some complex games easier or available to a wider group of consumers and enhanced player immersion with the aid of various stimuli like sound or animation 3 one may categorize hybrid games as follows purpose-built devices where the game uses a device that has certain functions like an electronic dice or spinner to play out the game an example would be monopoly electronic banking 2007 by hasbro 4 where all players have an electronic card which carries virtual monopoly currency and use a machine to increase and deduct their earnings beacon technology games are mobile digital games that employ ble bluetooth low energy beacons to track and control players movements and actions an example artifact technologies created a mobile digital board game called battlekasters 5 where players physically walk around to cast spells or unlock cards augmented reality board games that interact with a mobile device and immerse the player in the virtual environment through animation sound and or vibrations example roar by trefl 6 which utilises sound as part of the gameplay other electronics have been adapted for use in a wide range of applications board games such as dark tower for instance rely heavily upon electronics non-traditional electronic games such as rubik's revolution or electronic toys which blur the boundaries between games and toys such as the electronic magic 8 ball date ball
