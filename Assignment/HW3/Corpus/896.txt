space policy has since december 2009 been an area for voting in the european council under the european space policy of 2007 the eu esa and its member states committed themselves to increasing

relations with esa former italian astronaut umberto guidoni during his tenure as a member of the european parliament from 2004 to 2009 stressed the importance of the european union as a driving force for space exploration since other players are coming up such as india and china it is becoming ever more important that europeans can have an independent access to space we have to invest more into space research and technology in order to have an industry capable of competing with other international players 94 the first eu-esa international conference on human space exploration took place in prague on 22 and 23 october 2009.[95 a road map which would lead to a common vision and strategic planning in the area of space exploration was discussed ministers from all 29 eu and esa members as

formed the space shuttle has been the primary launch vehicle used by esa's astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with nasa in the 1980s and 1990s the spacelab programme was an esa-nasa joint research programme that had esa develop and manufacture orbital labs for the space shuttle for several flights on which esa participate with astronauts in experiments in robotic science

with contributions such as columbus a science laboratory module that was brought into orbit by nasa's sts-122 space shuttle mission and the cupola observatory module that was completed in july 2005 by alenia spazio for esa the current estimates for the iss are approaching 100 billion in total development construction and 10 years of maintaining the station of which esa has committed to paying 8 billion 101 about 90 of the costs of esa's iss share will be contributed by germany 41 france 28 and italy 20 german esa astronaut thomas reiter was the first long-term iss crew member esa has developed the automated transfer vehicle for iss resupply each atv has a cargo capacity of 7,667 kilograms 16,903 lb 102 the first atv jules verne was launched on 9 march 2008 and on 3 april 2008 successfully docked with the iss this manoeuvre considered a major technical feat involved using automated systems to allow the atv to track the iss moving at 27,000 km h and attach itself with an accuracy of 2 cm as of 2013 the spacecraft establishing supply links to the iss are the russian progress and soyuz european atv japanese kounotori htv and the usa cots program vehicles dragon and

a stark departure from past practice until now the ariane family of rockets has been built largely with money contributed by esa governments seeking to participate in the program rather than through competitive industry bids this means governments commit multiyear funding to the development with the expectation of a roughly 90 return on investment in the form of industrial workshare but in july
