space station  wikipediafor radio broadcasts sent from space see space radio station the mir station helped pave the way for the iss project in the 1990s the u s skylab station of the 1970s a space station also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers which is designed to remain in space most commonly as an artificial satellite in low earth orbit for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock a space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems instead other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station as of september 2016   [21 in april 2008 the russian space agency proposed the construction of an orbital construction yard opsek for spacecraft too heavy to launch from earth directly it would not begin construction or be finished until after the decommissioning of the international space station 22 this plan was described to iss partners by anatoly perminov june 17 2009.[23 the orbital technologies commercial space station is a project of a russian corporation orbital technologies the css is intended to accommodate diverse functions such as citation needed enabling space-based microgravity research providing a destination for commercial human spaceflight space tourism and state sponsored human spaceflight programs acting as a backup and emergency safe haven for the international space station and its crew enabling product development facilitating satellite servicing and maintenance providing a staging outpost for human space flight missions beyond low arth orbit supplying a uniquely capable remote sensing platform proposed exploration gateway platform at eml-1 the business arrangement for developing and marketing the station was recently clarified by russian firm orbital technologies who is collaborating to develop the station with the rocket and space technology corporation energia rsc energia 24 in december 2011 boeing proposed using node 4 as the core of an exploration gateway platform to be constructed at the iss and relocated via space tug to an earth-moon lagrange point eml-1 or 2 the purpose of the platform would be to support lunar landing missions with a reusable lunar lander after the first two sls flights it would also bypass the need for a l1 propellant depot for lunar missions other hardware would include an airlock an international module and a mplm based habitat module 25 in february 2012 playboy proposed an orbital space club
