supply ship at mir by malenchenko on november 4 1994 malenchenko musabayev and ulf merbold returned to earth aboard their soyuz capsule after landing 88 km northeast of arkalyk aboard soyuz tm-19 and

specialist for sts-106.[7 space shuttle atlantis lifted off from the kennedy space center ksc on september 8 2000 on flight day two atlantis completed a successful rendezvous and docking with the iss the objectives of the mission were to bring supplies to the international space station iss and to prepare the zvezda service module for the arrival of the first resident crew during the 12-day mission the shuttle crew spent a week inside the iss unloading supplies from both a double spacehab cargo module in the rear of atlantis's cargo bay and from progress m1-3 which was docked to the aft docking port of zvezda after circling the globe for 186 orbits atlantis landed on september 19 2000 at runway 15 ksc the mission lasted 11 days 19 hours and 12 minutes expedition 7 malenchenko with

april 19 2008 bringing back malenchenko whitson and south korean spaceflight participant yi so-yeon similar to soyuz tma-1 and soyuz tma-10 soyuz tma-11 performed a ballistic reentry a reentry steeper than a normal reentry due to a malfunction and landed 475 km from intended landing point north of arkalyk 10 although the crew were recovered with no injuries the spacecraft's hatch and antenna suffered burn damage during the unusual reentry he accumulated 191 days 19 hours and 8 minutes time in space during soyuz tma-11 and iss expedition 16 missions expedition 32 33 spacewalks expedition 16 flight engineer yuri malenchenko participates in a spacewalk malenchenko conducted his first and second career spacewalks during the mir-16 mission he and musabayev performed two spacewalks on september 9 1994 5h 06m and september 14 1994 in which the station's external insulation was repaired the first and second spacewalks lasted 5 hours and 6 minutes and 6 hours and 1 minute respectively malenchenko performed his third career spacewalk during the sts-106 mission to the iss 11 on flight day three malenchenko and nasa astronaut ed lu conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk the spacewalk started at 04:55 gmt on september 11 when the two spacewalkers exited the shuttle's airlock 12 the spacewalk's objective focused on routing and connecting nine power data and communications cables between the zvezda module and the zarya module as well as installing the six-foot-long magnetometer to the iss to serve as a compass showing the space station in respect to the earth this spacewalk marked the sixth spacewalk in support of the iss assembly and the 50th spacewalk in space shuttle history 13 expedition 32 flight engineer malenchenko participates in a spacewalk on 20 august 2012 on november 9 2007 malenchenko performed his fourth career spacewalk 14 he and expedition 16 commander peggy whitson in us emus ventured into space from the station's quest airlock at 09:54 utc 15 malenchenko's suit was all white and the purpose of the spacewalk was to prepare for the relocation of pressurized mating adapter pma-2 and the subsequent move of the harmony node to its permanent location as the first task the two spacewalkers disconnected the station to shuttle power transfer system sspts cables between the destiny laboratory and pma-2 next they disconnected eight other cables between pma-2 and the destiny malenchenko removed and replaced a failed electrical circuit box and together with whitson removed the active common berthing mechanism cover that was located at the outboard end of harmony next malenchenko moved back behind the z1 truss to reconfigure a power system removing an electrical jumper the spacewalk ended at 16.49 utc when the two spacewalkers returned to the iss the spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 55 minutes on 20 august 2012 malenchenko together with cosmonaut gennady padalka participated in his fifth career spacewalk 16 tasks assigned to the two cosmonauts included hardware relocations installations retrievals and deployments for the spacewalk malenchenko donned an orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe the duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes the spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between space station modules the spacewalk started from the pirs docking compartment module at 15:37 gmt the first task for padalka and malenchenko was to relocate the strela-2 boom from the pirs module to the forward end of the zarya module the relocation was needed since pirs module will be detached from the space station in the future for the arrival of the new multi-purpose laboratory module mlm nauka the next task completed by padalka and malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite the two cosmonauts also retrieved five debris shields from the pirs module prior to installing them on the zvezda module they also completed several get-ahead tasks since the both opted not to take rests during the night passes as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline they retrieved an external experiment called biorisk from the pirs module for return to earth and for added stability installed two structural support struts between the pirs module and the eva ladder padalka and malenchenko then both ingress the pirs module prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure to end a highly successful spacewalk yuri malenchenko in the cupola module during expedition 47 expedition 46 47 the soyuz tma-19m crew during a fit check malenchenko arrived at the iss soyuz tma-19m to join the expedition 46 crew he performed a manual docking due to a malfunction in the automatic docking system progress ms-1 was then scheduled for launch to the iss atop a soyuz 2.1a on 21 december planned for a launch date of no earlier than 7 february 2016,[17 the spacex crs-8 mission provided the iss with the bigelow expandable activity module two evas were performed during expedition 46.[18 he returned to earth on soyuz tma-19m and landed on 18 june 2016 09:15 utc 19 after spending additional 186 days in space 20 references this
