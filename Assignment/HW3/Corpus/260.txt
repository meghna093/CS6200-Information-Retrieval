brine pool  bodies by salinity v t e international association for the physical sciences of the oceans iapso standard seawater salinity is the saltiness or amount of salt dissolved in a body of water see also soil salinity this is usually measured in note that this is technically dimensionless salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry of natural waters and of biological processes within it and is a thermodynamic state variable that along with temperature and pressure governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water a contour line of constant salinity is called an isohaline or sometimes isohale definitions salinity in rivers lakes and the ocean is conceptually simple but technically challenging to define and measure precisely conceptually the salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water salts are compounds like sodium chloride magnesium sulfate potassium nitrate and sodium bicarbonate which dissolve into ions the concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity operationally dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter historically a filter with a pore size of 0.45 m but nowadays usually 0.2 m 2 salinity can be expressed in the form of a mass fraction i e the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution seawater typically has a mass salinity of around 35 g kg although lower values are typical near coasts where rivers enter the ocean rivers and lakes can have a wide range of salinities from less than 0.01 g kg   [11 lakes and rivers limnologists and chemists often define salinity in terms of mass of salt per unit volume expressed in units of mg per litre or g per litre 6 it is implied although often not stated that this value applies accurately only at some reference temperature values presented in this way are typically accurate to the order of 1 limnologists also use electrical conductivity or reference conductivity as a proxy for salinity this measurement may be corrected for temperature effects and is usually expressed in units of s cm a river or lake water with a salinity of around 70 mg l will typically have a specific conductivity at 25 c of between 80 and 130 s cm the actual ratio depends on the ions present 12 the actual conductivity usually changes by about 2 per degree celsius so the measured conductivity at 5 c might only be in the range of 5080 s cm direct density measurements are also used to estimate salinities particularly in highly saline lakes 4 sometimes density at a specific temperature is used as a proxy for salinity at other times an empirical salinity density relationship developed for a particular body of water is used to estimate the salinity of samples from a measured density water salinity fresh water brackish water saline water brine  0.05 0.05  3 3  5  5  0.5  0.5  30  30  50   50  systems of classification of water bodies based upon salinity thalassic series 300 hyperhaline 6080 metahaline 40 mixoeuhaline 30 polyhaline 18 mesohaline 5 oligohaline 0.5 marine waters are those of the ocean another term for which is euhaline seas the salinity of euhaline seas is 30 to 35 brackish seas or waters have salinity in the range of 0.5 to 29 and metahaline seas from 36 to 40 these waters are all regarded as thalassic because their salinity is derived from the ocean and defined as homoiohaline if salinity does not vary much over time essentially constant the table on the right modified from por 1972 13 follows the venice system 1959 14 in contrast to homoiohaline environments are certain poikilohaline environments which may also be thalassic in which the salinity variation is biologically significant 15 poikilohaline water salinities may range anywhere from 0.5 to greater than 300 the important characteristic is that these waters tend to vary in salinity over some biologically meaningful range seasonally or on some other roughly comparable time scale put simply these are bodies of water with quite variable salinity highly saline water from which salts crystallize or are about to is referred to as brine environmental considerations salinity is an ecological factor of considerable importance influencing the types of organisms that live in a body of water as well salinity influences the kinds of plants that will grow either in a water body or on land fed by a water or by a groundwater 16 a plant adapted to saline conditions is called a halophyte a halophyte which is tolerant to residual sodium carbonate salinity are called glasswort or saltwort or barilla plants organisms mostly bacteria that can live in very salty conditions are classified as extremophiles or halophiles specifically an organism that can withstand a wide range of salinities is euryhaline salt is expensive to remove from water and salt content is an important factor in water use such as potability the degree of salinity in oceans is a driver of the world's ocean circulation where density changes due to both salinity changes and temperature changes at the surface of the ocean produce changes in buoyancy which cause the sinking and rising of water masses changes in the salinity of the oceans are thought to contribute to global changes in carbon dioxide as more saline waters are less soluble to carbon dioxide in addition during glacial periods the hydrography is such that a possible cause of reduced circulation is the production of stratified oceans hence it is difficult in this case to subduct water through the thermohaline circulation see also soil salinity control desalination salinometer fresh water seawater sodium adsorption ratio soil salinity stenohaline fish euryhaline fish
