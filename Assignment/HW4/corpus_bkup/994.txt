zvezda iss module  wikipedia zvezda station statistics launch date july 12 2000 launch vehicle proton-k docked july 26 2000 undocked permanently docked mass 20,320 kg 44,800 lb     there are two 9-inch-diameter 230 mm windows one in each of the two crew sleep compartments windows no 1 and 2 six 9-inch-diameter 230 mm windows no 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 on the forward transfer compartment earth facing floor as well a 16-inch-diameter 410 mm window in the main working compartment no 9 and one 3-inch-diameter 76 mm window in the aft transfer compartment no 10 there are a further three 9-inch-diameter 230 mm windows in the forward end of the forward transfer compartment no 12 13 and 14 for observing approaching craft note window no 11 is unaccounted for in all available sources zvezda also contains the elektron system that electrolyzes condensed humidity and waste water to provide hydrogen and oxygen the hydrogen is expelled into space and the oxygen is used for breathing air the condensed water and the waste water can be used for drinking in an emergency but ordinarily fresh water from earth is used there are 16 small thrusters and two large s5.79 thrusters for propulsion the oxidizer used for the propulsion system is dinitrogen tetroxide and the fuel is udmh the supply tanks being pressurised with nitrogen 8 additionally it has eight batteries for storing power the elektron system has required significant maintenance work having failed several times and requiring the crew to use the solid fuel oxygen generator canisters also called oxygen candles which were the cause of a fire on mir when it has been broken for extended amounts of time it also contains the vozdukh a system which removes carbon dioxide from the air based on the use of regenerable absorbers of carbon dioxide gas zvezda has been criticized for being excessively noisy and the crew has been observed wearing earplugs inside it zvezda contains the esa's digital management system a computer that controls iss 9 zvezda is also the home of the lada greenhouse which is a test for growing plants in space 10 connection to the iss progress docked to zvezda aft view the rocket used for launch to the iss carried advertising it was emblazoned with the logo of pizza hut restaurants 11] [13 for which they are reported to have paid more than us 1 million 14 the money helped support khrunichev state research and production space center and the russian advertising agencies that orchestrated the event 15 on july 26 2000 zvezda became the third component of the iss when it docked at the aft port of zarya zarya had already been attached to the u s unity module  later in july the computers aboard zarya handed over iss commanding functions to computers on zvezda 16 on september 11 2000 two members of the sts-106 space shuttle crew completed final connections between zvezda and zarya during a 6-hour 14 minute eva astronaut ed lu and cosmonaut yuri malenchenko connected nine cables between zvezda and zarya including four power cables four video and data cables and a fiber-optic telemetry cable 17 the next day sts-106 crew members floated into zvezda for the first time at 05:20 utc on september 12 2000.[18 zvezda provided early living quarters a life support system a communication system zvezda introduced a 10 mbit s ethernet network to the iss[19 electrical power distribution a data processing system a flight control system and a propulsion system these quarters and some but not all systems have since been supplemented by additional iss components the two main engines on zvezda can be used to raise the station's altitude this was done on april 25 2007 this was the first time the engines had been fired since zvezda arrived in 2000.[20 launch risks due to russian financial problems zvezda was launched with no backup and no insurance due to this risk nasa had constructed an interim control module in case it was delayed significantly or destroyed on launch interior zvezda's space toilet
