biology  wikipediafor other uses see biology disambiguation biology deals with the study of the many living organisms top e coli bacteria and gazelle bottom goliath beetle and tree fern biology is the natural science that involves the study of life and living organisms including their physical and chemical structure function development and evolution 1 modern biology is a vast field composed of many branches despite the broad scope and the complexity of the science there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single coherent field in general biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life genes as the basic unit of heredity and evolution as the engine that propels the creation of new species it is also understood that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment sub-disciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which life is studied the kinds of organisms studied and the methods used to study them biochemistry examines the rudimentary chemistry of life molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules cellular biology examines the basic building-block of all life the cell physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues organs and organ systems ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment and evolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of life 2 history main article history of biology ernst haeckel's tree of life 1879 the term biology is derived from the greek word  bios life and
