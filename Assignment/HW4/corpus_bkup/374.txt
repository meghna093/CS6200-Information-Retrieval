north atlantic oscillation  wikipediafor the rock band see north atlantic oscillation band not to be confused with atlantic multidecadal oscillation the north atlantic oscillation nao is a weather phenomenon in the north atlantic ocean of fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level slp between the icelandic low and the azores high through fluctuations in the strength of the icelandic low and the azores high it controls the strength and direction of westerly winds and location of storm tracks across the north atlantic 1 it is part of the arctic oscillation and varies over time with no particular periodicity citation needed the nao was discovered through several studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries 2 unlike the el nio-southern oscillation phenomenon in the pacific ocean the nao is a largely atmospheric mode it is one of the most important manifestations of climate fluctuations in the north atlantic and surrounding humid climates citation needed the north atlantic oscillation is closely related to the arctic oscillation ao or northern annular mode nam but should not be confused with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo definition the nao has multiple possible definitions the easiest to understand are those based on measuring the seasonal average air pressure difference between stations such as lisbon and stykkisholmur reykjavk ponta delgada azores and stykkisholmur reykjavk azores 18652002 gibraltar 18212007 and reykjavk      [22 in the north western part of the atlantic both of these winters were mild especially 2009-2010 which was the warmest recorded in canada the winter of 2010-2011 was particularly above normal in the northern arctic regions of that country 23 the probability of cold winters with much snow in central europe rises when the arctic is covered by less sea ice in summer scientists of the research unit potsdam of the alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research in the helmholtz association have decrypted a mechanism in which a shrinking summertime sea ice cover changes the air pressure zones in the arctic atmosphere and effects on european winter weather if there is a particularly large-scale melt of arctic sea ice in summer as observed in recent years two important effects are intensified firstly the retreat of the light ice surface reveals the darker ocean causing it to warm up more in summer from the solar radiation ice-albedo feedback mechanism secondly the diminished ice cover can no longer prevent the heat stored in the ocean being released into the atmosphere lid effect as a result of the decreased sea ice cover the air is warmed more greatly than it used to be particularly in autumn and winter because during this period the ocean is warmer than the atmosphere the warming of the air near to the ground leads to rising movements and the atmosphere becomes less stable one of these patterns is the air pressure difference between the arctic and mid-latitudes the so-called arctic oscillation with the azores highs and iceland lows known from the weather reports if this difference is high a strong westerly wind will result which in winter carries warm and humid atlantic air masses right down to europe in the negative phase when pressure differences are low cold arctic air can then easily penetrate southward through europe without being interrupted by the usual westerlies as has been the case frequently over the last three winters model calculations show that the air pressure difference with decreased sea ice cover in the arctic summer is weakened in the following winter enabling arctic cold to push down to mid-latitudes 24 winter of 201516 in europe despite one of the strongest el nino ever recorded in the pacific ocean a largely positive north atlantic oscillation prevailed over europe during the winter of 2015-2016 for example cumbria in england 25 registered one of the wettest months on record meanwhile the maltese islands in the mediterranean sea registered one of the driest years ever recorded up to beginning of march as the island's national average was only 235mm to date with some areas registering even less than 200mm 26
