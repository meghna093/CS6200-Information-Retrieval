minimal atlantic hurricane that dropped heavy rainfall across the lesser antilles in october 1990 the eleventh tropical cyclone and sixth hurricane of the 1990 atlantic hurricane season klaus developed from a tropical wave on october 3 a short distance east of dominica it drifted northwestward and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on october 5 though its closest approach to the lesser antilles was within 12 miles 19 km the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong wind shear which caused klaus to steadily weaken after deteriorating into a tropical depression klaus briefly restrengthened over the bahamas before dissipating on october 9 under the influence of developing tropical storm marco heavy rainfall on saint lucia destroyed about 15 of its yearly banana crop damage was heaviest on martinique where seven casualties occurred and 1,500 people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island resulting in some landslides the remnant moisture of klaus entered the southeastern united states dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties the same area was affected with more precipitation a few days later by tropical storm marco due to the damage caused by the storm the name klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 27 it tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge becoming convectively active and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the cape verde islands on september 28 the organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression as it approached the lesser antilles it organized further and despite unfavorable upper-level wind shear the system developed into tropical depression thirteen on october 3 while located about 115 miles 185 km h east of dominica located in an area of weak steering currents the depression drifted to the northwest and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm the national hurricane center designated it with the name klaus 1 upon becoming a tropical storm klaus was located in an area of 29 mph 47 km h of wind shear although concurrently it was located over warm water temperatures of 83.1 f 28.4 c 2 tracking through a highly baroclinic environment 3 the storm became better organized and at 1200 utc on october 5 klaus attained hurricane status about 30 miles 50 km east of antigua shortly thereafter it passed 12 miles 19 km east of barbuda its closest point of approach to the lesser antilles klaus reached peak winds of 80 mph 130 km h and a minimum central pressure of 985.0 mbar 29.09 inhg though most of its deep convection and strong winds remained to its northeast due to wind shear 1 at the time the hurricane was forecast to continue tracking to the north-northwest however after weakening to a tropical storm on october 6 klaus turned westward 3 klaus continued tracking just north of the lesser antilles and after continuing to deteriorate from the wind shear the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression on october 8 to the north of puerto rico later that day convection redeveloped over the center and klaus re-attained tropical storm status as it accelerated toward the northeast bahamas it briefly reached winds of 50 mph 85 km h 1 a low pressure area to its west over cuba had been steadily intensifying and building toward the surface and on october 9 it developed into a tropical depression the cyclone became the dominant system eventually becoming marco and klaus dissipated under the influence of the system late on october 9 the remnant moisture continued to the northwest reaching the coast of south carolina by october 11.[4 preparations shortly after klaus
