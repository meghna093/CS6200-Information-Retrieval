[33 stripping trees and scattering forest debris also provides fuel for wildfires such as a blaze that lasted three months in 1989 and burned 460 square miles 1,200 km2 of forest that had been stripped by hurricane gilbert 34 wind velocity gradients or horizontal wind shear size of cyclone the intensity of cyclone proximity to the cyclone and local scale cyclonic convection effects degree of exposure windward exposure leeward acceleration or local topographic sheltering shading and ecosystem species composition and forest structure assessments of cyclone damage done to tropical rainforest landscapes in northeast australia have produced the following typology for describing and mapping the variable impacts they have along their paths as follows 35 severe and extensive closest to the centre of cyclone impact appears to be multidirectional and is evidenced by crowns of most trees having been broken smashed or windthrown severe and localised closer to the cyclone centre than its edge direction of the destructive winds is clearly identifiable and severe canopy disruption is limited to the windward aspect of these forested areas moderate canopy disturbance closer to cyclone edge than its centre most of the tree stems are still standing with only some treefalls and most of the damage is the defoliation of the canopy and branch breakage slight canopy disturbance closest to cyclone edge occasional stem fall or branch breakage with most of the damage consisting of loss of foliage on the forest edges only subsequently followed by leaf damage and heavy leaf litter falls see also tropical cyclones portal tropical cyclones and climate change list of wettest tropical cyclones by country references
