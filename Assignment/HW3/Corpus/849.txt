granma two days ago out of 11 international press reports devoted to cuba none told about the hurricane that moved toward our island and the feverish efforts of our civil defense  castro writes instead the news services echoing a yankee press organization dedicated to the media war and campaigns against cuba  reported about the defection of tv actor yamil jaled the yankee press organization appears to be an allusion to el nuevo herald which broke the news of jaled's arrival in miami  what a patriot what a democrat what a brilliant example  wrote castro this way the world is informed about a character a lot less known and important than hurricane gustav they want to make a sacred cow out of him 151 retirement see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names because of the damage
