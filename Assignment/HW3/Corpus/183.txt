marginal sea of the atlantic ocean 1 largely surrounded by the north american continent 2 it is bounded on the northeast north and northwest by the gulf coast of the united states on the southwest and south by mexico and on the southeast by cuba the u s states of texas louisiana mississippi alabama and florida border the gulf on the north which are often referred to as the third coast in comparison with the u s atlantic and pacific coasts or sometimes the south coast in juxtaposition to the great lakes region being the north coast  one of the gulf's seven main areas is the gulf of mexico basin the gulf of mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics 3 the gulf's basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nautical miles 1,500 km 930 mi wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments it is connected to part of the atlantic ocean through the florida straits between the u s and cuba and with the caribbean with which it forms the american mediterranean sea via the yucatn channel between mexico and cuba with the narrow connection to the atlantic the gulf experiences very small tidal ranges the size of the gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 615,000 sq mi almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters the basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters 550 quadrillion imperial gallons 660 quadrillion

the limits of the continental shelf clcs regarding the extension of mexico's continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles 35 mexico sought an extension of its continental shelf in the western polygon based on international law unclos and bilateral treaties with the united states in accordance with mexico's domestic legislation on march 13 2009 the clcs accepted mexico's arguments for extending its continental shelf up to 350 nm into the western polygon since this would extend mexico's continental shelf well into territory claimed by the united states however mexico and the u s would need to

of mexico holdings are expected to provide an important baseline of understanding for future scientific studies on the impact of the deepwater horizon oil spill 38 in congressional testimony dr jonathan coddington associate director of research and collections at the smithsonian's national museum of natural history provides a detailed overview of the gulf collections and their sources which museum staff have made available on an online map the samples were collected for years by the former minerals management service renamed the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement to help predict the potential impacts of future oil gas explorations since 1979 the specimens have been deposited in the national collections of the national museum of natural history 39 see also list of invasive marine fish in the gulf of mexico pollution dead zone in the gulf of mexico the major environmental threats to the gulf are agricultural runoff and oil drilling there are frequent red tide algae blooms[40 that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore this has especially been plaguing the southwest and southern florida coast from the florida keys to north of pasco county florida the gulf contains a hypoxic dead zone that runs east-west along the texas-louisiana coastline in july 2008 researchers reported that between 1985 and 2008 the area roughly doubled in size and now stretches from near galveston texas to near venice louisiana it is now about 8,000 square miles 21,000 km2 nearly the record 41 poor agricultural practices in the northern portion of the gulf of mexico have led to a tremendous increase of nitrogen and phosphorus in neighboring marine ecosystems which has resulted in algae blooms and a lack of available oxygen occurrences of masculinization and estrogen suppression were observed as a result an october 2007 study of the atlantic croaker found a disproportioned sex ratio of 61 males to 39 females in hypoxic gulf sites this was compared with a 52 to 48 male-female ratio found in reference sites showing an impairment of reproductive output for fish populations inhabiting hypoxic coastal zones 42 there are 27,000 abandoned oil and gas wells beneath the gulf these have generally not been checked for potential environmental problems 43 ixtoc i explosion and oil spill main articles ixtoc i and ixtoc i oil spill in june 1979 the ixtoc i oil platform in the bay of campeche suffered a blowout leading to a catastrophic explosion which resulted in a massive oil spill that continued for nine months before the well was finally capped this was ranked as the largest oil spill in the gulf of mexico until the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010 deepwater horizon explosion and oil spill main articles deepwater horizon explosion and deepwater horizon oil spill on april 20 2010 the deepwater horizon oil platform located in the mississippi canyon about 40 miles 64 km off the louisiana coast suffered a catastrophic explosion it sank a day-and-a-half later 44 it was in the process of being sealed with cement for temporary abandonment to avoid environmental problems 43 although initial reports indicated that relatively little oil had leaked by april 24 it was claimed by bp that approximately 1,000 barrels 160 m3 of oil per day were issuing from the wellhead about 1-mile 1.6 km below the surface on the ocean floor 45 on april 29 the u s government revealed that approximately 5,000 barrels 790 m3 per day five times the original estimate were pouring into the gulf from the wellhead 46 the resulting oil slick quickly expanded to cover hundreds of square miles of ocean surface posing a serious threat to marine life and adjacent coastal wetlands and to the livelihoods of gulf coast shrimpers and fishermen 47 coast guard rear adm sally brice o'hare stated that the u s government will be employing booms skimmers chemical dispersants and controlled burns to combat the oil spill by may 1 2010 the oil spill cleanup efforts were underway but hampered by rough seas and the tea like consistency of the oil cleanup operations were resumed after conditions became favorable on may 27 2010 the usgs had revised the estimate of the leak from 5,000 barrels per day 790 m3 d to 12,00019,000 barrels per day 3,000 m3 d [48 an increase from earlier estimates on july 15 2010 bp announced that the leak stopped for the first time in 88 days in july 2015 bp reached an 18.7bn settlement with the us government the states of alabama florida louisiana mississippi and texas as well as 400 local authorities to date bp's cost for the clean-up environmental and economic damages and penalties has reached 54bn 49 minor oil

infrastructure on shell's brutus oil rig released 2,100 barrels of oil this leak created a visible 2 mile by 13 mile oil slick in the sea about 97 miles south of port fourchon louisiana according to
