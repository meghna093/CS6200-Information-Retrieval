atmosphere unit  wikipedia atmosphere unit of pressure symbol atm unit conversions 1 atm in is equal to si units 101.3250 kpa u s customary units 14.69595 psi the standard atmosphere symbol atm is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 pa 1.01325 bar it is sometimes used as a reference or standard pressure history in 1954 the 10th confrence gnrale des poids et mesures cgpm adopted standard atmosphere for general use and affirmed its definition of being precisely equal to 1,013,250 dynes per square centimetre 101325 pa 1 this value was intended to represent the mean atmospheric pressure at mean sea level at the latitude of paris france citation needed and does reflect the mean sea level pressure for many industrialized nations that are at broadly similar latitudes in chemistry and in various industries the reference pressure referred to in standard temperature and pressure stp was commonly 1 atm 101.325 kpa but standards have since diverged in 1982 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac recommended that for the purposes of specifying the physical properties of substances standard pressure should be precisely 100 kpa 1 bar 2 pressure units and equivalencies a pressure of 1 atm can also be stated as  torr and mm-hg 0c are often taken to be identical for most practical purposes to 5 significant digits they are interchangeable  a b c this is the customarily accepted value for cmh2o 4 c it is precisely the product of 1 kg-force per square centimeter one technical atmosphere times 1.013 25 bar atmosphere divided by 0.980 665 one gram-force it is not accepted practice to define the value for water column based on a true physical realization of water which would be 99.997 495 of this value because the true maximum density of vienna standard mean ocean water is 0.999 974 95 kg l at 3.984 c also this physical realization would still ignore the 8.285 cmh2o reduction that would actually occur in a true physical realization due to the vapor pressure over water at 3.984 c  a b nist value of 13.595 078 5 g ml assumed for the density of hg at 0 c other applications scuba divers and others use the word atmosphere and atm in relation to pressures that are relative to mean atmospheric pressure at sea level 1.013 bar citation needed for example a partial pressure of oxygen is calibrated typically using air at sea level so is expressed in units of atm the old european unit technical atmosphere at is equal to 1 kilogram-force per square centimetre kgf cm2 700498066500000000098066.5 pa citation needed see also standard conditions for temperature and pressure atmospheric pressure international standard atmosphere references  bipm definition of the standard atmosphere  iupac org gold book standard pressure  scuba diving  other fun activities the difference between an atm  an ata
