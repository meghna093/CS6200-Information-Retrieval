maddenjulian oscillation  wikipedia the maddenjulian oscillation mjo is the largest element of the intraseasonal 30 to 90-day variability in the tropical atmosphere it was discovered in 1971 by roland madden and paul julian of the american national center for atmospheric research ncar it is a large-scale coupling between atmospheric circulation and tropical deep convection 1][2 unlike a standing pattern like the el nio southern oscillation enso the maddenjulian oscillation is a traveling pattern that propagates eastward at approximately 4 to 8 m s 14 to 29 km h 9 to 18 mph through the atmosphere above the warm parts of the indian and pacific oceans this overall circulation pattern manifests itself most clearly as anomalous rainfall the maddenjulian oscillation is characterized by an eastward progression of large regions of both enhanced and suppressed tropical rainfall observed mainly over the indian and pacific ocean the anomalous rainfall is usually first evident over the western indian ocean and remains evident as it propagates over the very warm ocean waters of the western and central tropical pacific this pattern of tropical rainfall then generally becomes nondescript as it moves over the cooler ocean waters of the eastern pacific except over the region of warmer water off the west coast of central america but occasionally reappears at low amplitude over the tropical atlantic and higher amplitude over the indian ocean the wet phase of enhanced convection and precipitation is followed by a dry phase where thunderstorm activity is suppressed each cycle lasts approximately 3060 days because of this pattern the maddenjulian oscillation is also known as the 30 to 60-day oscillation 30 to 60-day wave or intraseasonal oscillation behavior distinct patterns of lower-level and upper-level atmospheric circulation anomalies accompany the mjo-related pattern of enhanced or decreased tropical rainfall across the tropics these circulation features extend around the globe and are not confined to only the eastern hemisphere the maddenjulian oscillation moves eastward at between 4 m s 14 km h 9 mph and 8 m s 29 km h 18 mph across the tropics crossing the earth's tropics in 30 to 60 dayswith the active phase of the mjo tracked by the degree of outgoing long wave radiation which is measured by infrared-sensing geostationary weather satellites the lower the amount of outgoing long wave radiation the stronger the thunderstorm complexes or convection is within that region 3 enhanced surface upper level westerly winds occur near the west east side of the active convection 4 ocean currents up to 100 metres 330 ft in depth from the ocean surface follow in phase with the east-wind component of the surface winds in advance or to the east of the mjo enhanced activity winds aloft are westerly in its wake or to the west of the enhanced rainfall area winds aloft are easterly these wind changes aloft are due to the divergence present over the active thunderstorms during the enhanced phase its direct influence can be tracked poleward as far as 30 degrees latitude from the equator in both northern and southern hemispheres propagating outward from its origin near the equator at around 1 degree latitude or 111 kilometres 69 mi per day 5 local effects connection to the monsoon onset dates and prevailing wind currents of the southwest summer monsoon see also monsoon and monsoon trough during the northern hemisphere summer season the mjo-related effects on the indian and west african summer monsoon are well documented mjo-related effects on the north american summer monsoon also occur though they are relatively weaker mjo-related impacts on the north american summer precipitation patterns are strongly linked to meridional i e northsouth adjustments of the precipitation pattern in the eastern tropical pacific a strong relationship between the leading mode of intraseasonal variability of the north american monsoon system the mjo and the points of origin of tropical cyclones is also present a period of warming sea surface temperatures are found five to ten days prior to a strengthening of mjo-related precipitation across southern asia a break in the asian monsoon normally during the month of july has been attributed to the maddenjulian oscillation after its enhanced phase moves off to the east of the region into the open tropical pacific ocean 6 influence on tropical cyclogenesis see also tropical cyclogenesis tropical cyclones occur throughout the boreal warm season typically maynovember in both the north pacific and the north atlantic basinsbut any given year has periods of enhanced or suppressed activity within the season evidence suggests that the maddenjulian oscillation modulates this activity particularly for the strongest storms by providing a large-scale environment that is favorable or unfavorable for development mjo-related descending motion is not favorable for tropical storm development however mjo-related ascending motion is a favorable pattern for thunderstorm formation within the tropics which is quite favorable for tropical storm development as the mjo progresses eastward the favored region for tropical cyclone activity also shifts eastward from the western pacific to the eastern pacific and finally to the atlantic basin an inverse relationship exists between tropical cyclone activity in the western north pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main reason for this appears to be the phase of the mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time 7 while this relationship appears robust the mjo is one of many factors that contribute to the development of tropical cyclones for example sea surface temperatures must be sufficiently warm and vertical wind shear must be sufficiently weak for tropical disturbances to form and persist 8 however the mjo also influences these conditions that facilitate or suppress tropical cyclone formation the mjo is monitored routinely by both the usa national hurricane center and the usa climate prediction center during the atlantic hurricane tropical cyclone season to aid in anticipating periods of relative activity or inactivity 9 downstream effects link to the el nino-southern oscillation see also el nio southern oscillation there is strong year-to-year interannual variability in maddenjulian oscillation activity with long periods of strong activity followed by periods in which the oscillation is weak or absent this interannual variability of the mjo is partly linked to the el nio-southern oscillation enso cycle in the pacific strong mjo activity is often observed 6  12 months prior to the onset of an el nio episode but is virtually absent during the maxima of some el nio episodes while mjo activity is typically greater during a la nia episode strong events in the maddenjulian oscillation over a series of months in the western pacific can speed the development of an el nio or la nia but usually do not in themselves lead to the onset of a warm or cold enso event 10 however observations suggest that the 1982-1983 el nio developed rapidly during july 1982 in direct response to a kelvin wave triggered by an mjo event during late may 11 further changes in the structure of the mjo with the seasonal cycle and enso might facilitate more substantial impacts of the mjo on enso for example the surface westerly winds associated with active mjo convection are stronger during advancement toward el nio and the surface easterly winds associated with the suppressed convective phase are stronger during advancement toward la nina 12 globally the inter annual variability of the mjo is most determined by atmospheric internal dynamics clarification needed north american winter precipitation see also effects of the el nio-southern oscillation in the united states and united states rainfall climatology the strongest impacts of intraseasonal variability on the united states occur during the winter months over the western u s during the winter this region receives the bulk of its annual precipitation storms in this region can last for several days or more and are often accompanied by persistent atmospheric circulation features of particular concern are extreme precipitation events linked to flooding strong evidence suggests a link between weather and climate in this region from studies that have related the el nio southern oscillation to regional precipitation variability in the tropical pacific winters with weak-to-moderate cold or la nina episodes or enso-neutral conditions are often characterized by enhanced 30 to 60-day maddenjulian oscillation activity a recent example is the winter of 199697 which featured heavy flooding in california and in the pacific northwest estimated damage costs of 2.03.0 billion at the time of the event and a very active mjo such winters are also characterized by relatively small sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical pacific compared to stronger warm and cold episodes in these winters there is a stronger link between the mjo events and extreme west coast precipitation events pineapple express events main article pineapple express the pineapple express an mjo effect on north american weather patterns the typical scenario linking the pattern of tropical rainfall associated with the mjo to extreme precipitation events in the pacific northwest features a progressive i e eastward moving circulation pattern in the tropics and a retrograding i e westward moving circulation pattern in the mid latitudes of the north pacific typical wintertime weather anomalies preceding heavy precipitation events in the pacific northwest are as follows 13 710 days prior to the heavy precipitation event heavy tropical rainfall associated with the mjo shifts eastward from the eastern indian ocean to the western tropical pacific a moisture plume extends northeastward from the western tropical pacific towards the general vicinity of the hawaiian islands a strong blocking anticyclone is located in the gulf of alaska with a strong polar jet stream around its northern flank 13 35 days prior to the heavy precipitation event heavy tropical rainfall shifts eastward towards the date line and begins to diminish the associated moisture plume extends further to the northeast often traversing the hawaiian islands the strong blocking high weakens and shifts westward a split in the north pacific jet stream develops characterized by an increase in the amplitude and areal extent of the upper tropospheric westerly zonal winds on the southern flank of the block and a decrease on its northern flank the tropical and extra tropical circulation patterns begin to phase allowing a developing mid latitude trough to tap the moisture plume extending from the deep tropics 13 the heavy precipitation event as the pattern of enhanced tropical rainfall continues to shift further to the east and weaken the deep tropical moisture plume extends from the subtropical central pacific into the mid latitude trough now located off the west coast of north america the jet stream at upper levels extends across the north pacific with the mean jet position entering north america in the northwestern united states the deep low pressure located near the pacific northwest coast can bring up to several days of heavy rain and possible flooding these events are often referred to as pineapple express events so named because a significant amount of the deep tropical moisture traverses the hawaiian islands on its way towards western north america 13 throughout this evolution retrogression of the large-scale atmospheric circulation features is observed in the eastern pacificnorth american sector many of these events are characterized by the progression of the heaviest precipitation from south to north along the pacific northwest coast over a period of several days to more than one week however it is important to differentiate the individual synoptic-scale storms which generally move west to east from the overall large-scale pattern which exhibits retrogression 13 a coherent simultaneous relationship exists between the longitudinal position of maximum mjo-related rainfall and the location of extreme west coast precipitation events extreme events in the pacific northwest are accompanied by enhanced precipitation over the western tropical pacific and the region of southeast asia called by meteorologists the maritime continent with suppressed precipitation over the indian ocean and the central pacific as the region of interest shifts from the pacific northwest to california the region of enhanced tropical precipitation shifts further to the east for example extreme rainfall events in southern california are typically accompanied by enhanced precipitation near 170e however it is important to note that the overall link between the mjo and extreme west coast precipitation events weakens as the region of interest shifts southward along the west coast of the united states 13 there is case-to-case variability in the amplitude and longitudinal extent of the mjo-related precipitation so this should be viewed as a general relationship only 13 references external links wikimedia commons has media related to madden-julian oscillation daily maddenjulian oscillation indices national weather service climate prediction
