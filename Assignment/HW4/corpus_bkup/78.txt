wave known in some regions as a cold snap is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air specifically as used by the u s national weather service a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture industry commerce and social activities the precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls and the minimum to which it falls this minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year 1 in the united states a cold spell is defined as the national average high temperature dropping below 20 f 7 c 2 effects a cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals including humans and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow grazing animals may be unable to reach needed food and die of hypothermia or starvation they often necessitate the purchase of foodstuffs to feed livestock at considerable cost to farmers cold spells are associated with increased mortality rates in populations around the world 3 both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events 4 in developed countries more deaths occur during a heat wave than in a cold snap though the mortality rate is higher in undeveloped regions of the world globally more people die of cold weather than hot weather due to the rise in diseases like cold flu and pneumonia extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipelines and mains to freeze even some poorly protected indoor plumbing ruptures as water expands within them causing much damage to property and costly insurance claims demand for electrical power and fuels rises dramatically during such times even though the generation of electrical power may fail due to the freezing of water necessary for the generation of hydroelectricity some metals may become brittle at low temperatures motor vehicles may fail when antifreeze fails or motor oil gels producing a failure of the transportation system to be sure such is more likely in places like siberia and much of canada that customarily get very cold weather fires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable making firefighting more difficult the air during a cold wave is typically denser and thus contains more oxygen so when air that a fire draws in becomes unusually cold it is likely to cause a more intense fire winter cold waves that arent considered cold in some areas but cause temperatures significantly below average for an area are also destructive areas with subtropical climates may recognize unusual cold perhaps barely freezing temperatures as a cold wave in such places plant and animal life is less tolerant of such cold as may appear rarely the same winter temperatures that one associates with the norm for colorado ohio or bavaria are catastrophic to winter crops in places like florida california or parts of south america that grow fruit and vegetables in winter cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth resulting in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvested economically such cold waves have caused famines at times as deadly to plants as drought cold waves can leave a land in danger of later brush and forest fires that consume dead biomass one extreme was the so-called year without a summer of 1816 one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruptions that reduced incoming sunlight countermeasures in some places such as siberia extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run continuously internal plumbing can be wrapped and persons can often run water continuously through pipes energy conservation difficult as it is in a cold wave may require such measures as collecting people especially the poor and elderly in communal shelters even the homeless may be arrested and taken to shelters only to be released when the hazard abates 5 hospitals can prepare for the admission of victims of frostbite and hypothermia schools and other public buildings can be converted into shelters people can stock up on food water and other necessities before a cold wave some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates at least during the winter suitable stocks of forage can be secured before cold waves for livestock and livestock in vulnerable areas might be shipped from affected areas or even slaughtered smudge pots can bring smoke that prevents hard freezes on a farm or grove vulnerable crops may be sprayed with water that will paradoxically protect the plants by freezing and absorbing the cold from surrounding air most people can dress appropriately and can even layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail they can also stock candles matches flashlights and portable fuel for cooking and wood for fireplaces or wood stoves as necessary however caution should be taken as the use of charcoal fires for cooking or heating within an enclosed dwelling is extremely dangerous due to carbon monoxide poisoning adults must remain aware of the exposure that children and the elderly have to cold historical cold waves contemporary cold waves since 2001 cold wave of november 9-12 2017 record lows were broken from minneapolis to dc as arctic air swept through the areas january 2017 european cold wave  a cold wave hit central and east europe at january 5 the lowest temperature was 45.4 c 49.7 f degrees 6 the cold caused at least 60 deaths there was also massive snowfall january 2016 east asia cold wave  caused over 100 known deaths across east asia south asia and southeast asia february 2015 north american cold wave  during the second half of february 2015 temperature records were broken in both sides of the spectrum extreme warm records were broken in the western half of the united states and extreme cold records were broken in the eastern half in addition to the extreme cold wave at its most brutal in the great lakes mid-atlantic and new england snowfall were reported as far south as tupelo mississippi huntsville alabama and shreveport louisiana the cold wave became widespread and all the remaining mild conditions from the west were pushed into northern mexico the cold wave even extended well into early march with a part of every u s state except florida reported a snow cover by march 1 2015 november 2014 north

bozeman and cato snowfall records were confirmed all over the midwest and the northeast especially around the great lakes buffalo new york was among the hardest hit in the unseasonably wintry november in addition to not being thanksgiving yet autumn colors were in the mix along with the deep winter snow early 2014 north american cold wave  on january 211 cold arctic air initially associated with a nor'easter invaded the central and eastern united states and canada east of the rockies temperatures were even colder than the north pole and the south pole in many regions in the upper midwest and canada temperatures reached as cold as 37 f 38 c and did not even get out of the negative double-digit temps in many places including chicago the cold wave extended for a few more months bringing a continuous pattern of record-low temperatures to most of the central and upper eastern united states before the pattern finally ended in early april december 2013 north american cold wave  on december 1 the weakening of the polar vortex resulted in the jet stream shifting southward which allowed abnormally cold temperatures to intrude the central united states on december 6 a daily record snowfall of 0.1 inches 2 mm was set in the dallasfort worth metroplex breaking the old record of trace amounts of snow set in 1950.
