cosmodrome administrator igor komarov budget 186.5 billion rubles 2015     [29 the five geckos four females and one male were used as a part of the gecko-f4 research program aimed at measuring the effects of weightlessness on the lizards ability to procreate and develop in the harsh environment however soon after the spacecraft exited the atmosphere mission control lost contact with the vessel which led to an attempt to reestablish communication that was only achieved later in the mission when the satellite returned to earth after its planned two-month mission was cut short to 44 days the geckos were reported by the space agency researchers to have all perished during the course of their travels the exact cause that led to the deaths of the geckos was declared unknown by the scientific team in charge of the project reports from the institute of medical and biological problems in russia have indicated that the lizards had been dead for at least a week prior to their return to earth a number of those connected to the mission have theorized that a failure in the vessels heating system may have caused the cold blooded reptiles to freeze to death included in the mission were a number of fruit flies plants and mushrooms which all survived the mission 30 launch control the military counterpart of the rka is the military space forces vko the vko controls russia's plesetsk cosmodrome
