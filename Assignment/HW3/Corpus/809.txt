following the severe damage and unprecedented loss of life caused by hurricane fifi its name was retired at the end of the 1974 season as such the name was removed from the rotating lists of names used in the atlantic hurricane basin however fifi was not replaced by any particular name due to a change in the atlantic hurricane naming scheme in 1979.[39 at the time fifi was the first category 2 hurricane to have its name retired since then three other storms of this intensity hurricanes diana juan and tomas in 1990 2003 and 2010 respectively were retired 39 response and assistance in the wake of the storm relief agencies and the honduras government were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the disaster 20 rescue planes flown throughout the country reported that hundreds of bodies were floating in rivers and water covered areas once occupied by towns 17 for the first three days relief efforts were generally minimal due to the extremely poor state of the roads across honduras numerous countries send tonnes of aid to the battered country although it was initially stockpiled by the government until it could be properly distributed 20 by september 24 planes filled with relief supplies were being flown to honduras from the united states cuba costa rica el salvador mexico guatemala and venezuela relief crews overwhelmed by the number of bodies began taking desperate measures to prevent the spread of diseases an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 bodies were burned by september 24.[16 four helicopters supplied by the united states from the panama canal quickly began rescue missions they airlifted survivors from flood waters and placed them on elevated land areas the crew members reported that the people were desperate to get on the helicopters and during one mission 34 people crowded on to one of the aircraft which has a normal capacity of 15 food packages dropped to survivors were fought over some people reportedly fighting each other with machetes for the supplies 40 during several of the later rescue missions people died from starvation and malnutrition on board the helicopters 41 from nearby belize britain deployed 57 soldiers with motorboats to rush food to survivors in flooded regions a group of 41 cuban medical experts including 21 doctors treated nearly 900 in a period of two days 42 storm total rainfall for fifi orlene in mexico by september 24 more than 350,000 people sought refuge in shelters set up throughout the country 43 red cross volunteers were overwhelmed by the number of families requesting help to find missing relatives 44 relief planes sent by the united states were initially delayed by continued inclement weather several days after the storm's passage they were able to land in the country these planes were loaded with food clothes water medicine and other emergency supplies 18 juan bautista described the disaster wrought by fifi as the worst moment in the nation's 150 year history since independence 45 donation centers were set up throughout major cities in the united states by the honduran government they planned to fill three planes and five or six ships with supplies that would be brought to the country 45 in miami florida governor reubin askew asked all residents to donate to the red cross or salvation army to help those affected by the hurricane 46 in st petersburg florida a team of 14 doctors was sent to the country on october 9.[47 other doctors set up fund drives one set for 50,000 however officials in honduras believed that this would be nowhere near the necessary funds for what would become a multibillion-dollar disaster 48 numerous other nations and relief agencies joined in the effort to aid honduras in what was considered one of the largest relief operations in history 49 days after the storm brigades deployed by the honduran military began to reach the hardest-hit areas as floodwaters started to recede 50 from miami alone 14 tons of relief goods were donated to honduras 23 roughly a month after the storm struck the united states had donated roughly 1.8 million pounds 816,000 kg of relief supplies government agencies also began working on plans to revive the broken economy 51 an initial plan costing 5 million to restart the agricultural business was set up and another 15 million was set to be given out as a two-year loan 52 one group of people from a baptist church in texas spent 30,000 on a custom-designed food wagon to distribute food to the people of el progreso in some areas residents did not know how to use certain supplies such as toilet paper and tea bags due to their culture and isolation from urban areas  a british helicopter team dropped toilet paper and tea bags to the people of el progreso who are unfamiliar with both items using the toilet paper as wrappers the villagers smoked the tea 51 in honduras the red cross and other relief agencies quickly attempted to unload planes to assure that supplies would reach victims however some of the supplies were hoarded by the honduran military as they quickly went to unload the planes one of the incidents took place after a plane carrying supplies from argentina landed and the military forced the volunteer members away from the plane once in the hands of the military the fate of the supplies was unknown 53 as the full amount of supplies did not reach victims reports of people starving to death surfaced eventually relief crews found these reports to be true as they distributed food to those who survived 54 following the storm the country's economy suffered for two years during this time the annual decifit reached 200 million against the annual income of 153 million 55 rebuilding in 1977 a large-scale reconstruction project involving six villages across honduras began the first of the six project areas contained 121 homes with an average of 25 square meters of space it was located along an important highway in northern honduras however the rebuilding was initially delayed by erosion issues the second plan consisted of 127 homes roughly a mile south of the first the third consisting of 26 concrete homes was placed in the city of el progreso this project was determined to house the most people per home roughly seven occupants for a preliminary total of 182 people the fourth was the most isolated of the six planned constructions in a rural area far outside urban regions 92 homes were planned to be constructed the fifth project consisting of 33 homes was placed close to the first project having a similar access to the major highway the final housing project and largest was set up south of the destroyed town of choloma a total of 600 homes all built on concrete blocks and doubled up were placed in this housing project 56 see also tropical cyclones portal list of atlantic
