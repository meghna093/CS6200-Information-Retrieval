troposphere  wikipedia the troposphere is the lowest layer of earth's atmosphere and is also where nearly all weather conditions take place it contains approximately 75 of the atmosphere's mass and 99 of the total mass of water vapor and aerosols 2 the average depths of the troposphere are 20 km 12 mi in the tropics 17 km 11 mi in the mid latitudes and 7 km 4.3 mi in the polar regions in winter the lowest part of the troposphere where friction with the earth's surface influences air flow is the planetary boundary layer this layer is typically a few hundred meters to 2 km 1.2 mi deep depending on the landform and time of day atop the troposphere is the tropopause which is the border between the troposphere and stratosphere the tropopause is an inversion layer where the air temperature ceases to decrease with height and remains constant through its thickness 3 the word troposphere derives from the greek tropos for turn turn toward trope and sphere as in the earth reflecting the fact that rotational turbulent mixing plays an important role in the troposphere's structure and behaviour most of the phenomena associated with day-to-day weather occur in the troposphere 3 diagram showing the five primary layers of the earth's atmosphere exosphere thermosphere mesosphere stratosphere and troposphere the layers are to scale from earth's surface to the top of the stratosphere 50km is just under 1 of earth's radius pressure and temperature structure a view of earth's troposphere from an airplane composition by volume dry air contains 78.08 nitrogen 20.95 oxygen 0.93 argon 0.04 carbon dioxide and small amounts of other gases air also contains a variable amount of water vapor except for the water vapor content the composition of the troposphere is essentially uniform the source of water vapor is at the earth's surface through the process of evaporation the temperature of the troposphere decreases with altitude and saturation vapor pressure decreases strongly as temperature drops hence the amount of water vapor that can exist in the atmosphere decreases strongly with altitude and the proportion of water vapor is normally greatest near the surface of the earth pressure the pressure of the atmosphere is maximum at sea level and decreases with altitude this is because the atmosphere is very nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium so that the pressure is equal to the weight of air above a given point the change in pressure with altitude can be equated to the density with the hydrostatic equation [4 the troposphere is heated from below by latent heat longwave radiation and sensible heat surplus heating and vertical expansion of the troposphere occurs in the tropics at middle latitudes tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 15 c at sea level to about 55 c at the tropopause at the poles tropospheric temperature only decreases from an average of 0 c at sea level to about 45 c at the tropopause at the equator tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 20 c at sea level to about 70 to 75 c at the tropopause the troposphere is thinner at the poles and thicker at the equator the average thickness of the tropical tropopause is roughly 7 kilometers greater than the average tropopause thickness at the poles 7 tropopause main article tropopause the tropopause is the boundary region between the troposphere and the stratosphere measuring the temperature change with height through the troposphere and the stratosphere identifies the location of the tropopause in the troposphere temperature decreases with altitude in the stratosphere however the temperature remains constant for a while and then increases with altitude the region of the atmosphere where the lapse rate changes from positive in the troposphere to negative in the stratosphere is defined as the tropopause 3 thus the tropopause is an inversion layer and there is little mixing between the two layers of the atmosphere atmospheric flow the flow of the atmosphere generally moves in a west to east direction this however can often become interrupted creating a more north to south or south to north flow these scenarios are often described in meteorology as zonal or meridional these terms however tend to be used in reference to localised areas of atmosphere at a synoptic scale a fuller explanation of the flow of atmosphere around the earth as a whole can be found in the three-cell model zonal flow a zonal flow regime note the dominant west-to-east flow as shown in the 500 hpa height pattern a zonal flow regime is the meteorological term meaning that the general flow pattern is west to east along the earth's latitude lines with weak shortwaves embedded in the flow 8 the use of the word zone refers to the flow being along the earth's latitudinal zones this pattern can buckle and thus become a meridional flow meridional flow meridional flow pattern of october 23 2003 note the amplified troughs and ridges in this 500 hpa height pattern when the zonal flow buckles the atmosphere can flow in a more longitudinal or meridional direction and thus the term meridional flow arises meridional flow patterns feature strong amplified troughs of low pressure and ridges of high pressure with more north-south flow in the general pattern than west-to-east flow 9 three-cell model main article atmospheric circulation atmospheric circulation shown with three large cells the three cells model of the atmosphere attempts to describe the actual flow of the earth's atmosphere as a whole it divides the earth into the tropical hadley cell mid latitude ferrel cell and polar polar cell regions to describe energy flow and global atmospheric circulation mass flow its fundamental principle is that of balance  the energy that the earth absorbs from the sun each year is equal to that which it loses to space by radiation this overall earth energy balance however does not apply in each latitude due to the varying strength of the sun in each cell as a result of the tilt of the earth's axis in relation to its orbit the result is a circulation of the atmosphere that transports warm air poleward from the tropics and cold air equatorward from the poles the effect of the three cells is the tendency to even out the heat and moisture in the earth's atmosphere around the planet 10 synoptic scale observations and concepts forcing forcing is a term used by meteorologists to describe the situation where a change or an event in one part of the atmosphere causes a strengthening change in another part of the atmosphere it is usually used to describe connections between upper middle or lower levels such as upper-level divergence causing lower level convergence in cyclone formation but also be to describe such connections over lateral distance rather than height alone in some respects teleconnections could be considered a type of forcing divergence and convergence an area of convergence is one in which the total mass of air is increasing with time resulting in an increase in pressure at locations below the convergence level recall that atmospheric pressure is just the total weight of air above a given point divergence is the opposite of convergence  an area where the total mass of air is decreasing with time resulting in falling pressure in regions below the area of divergence where divergence is occurring in the upper atmosphere there will be air coming in to try to balance the net loss of mass this is called the principle of mass conservation and there is a resulting upward motion positive vertical velocity another way to state this is to say that regions of upper air divergence are conducive to lower level convergence cyclone formation and positive vertical velocity therefore identifying regions of upper air divergence is an important step in forecasting the formation of a surface low pressure area see also atmospheric sciences portal references  nasa gov gallery images shuttle sts-130 html
