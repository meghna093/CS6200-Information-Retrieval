civilian salyut space stations salyut 2 failed shortly after achieving orbit but salyut 3 and salyut 5 both conducted successful manned testing following salyut 5 the soviet ministry of defence judged in 1978 that the time consumed by station maintenance outweighed the benefits relative to automatic reconnaissance satellites the space stations cores were known internally as ops russian  grau index

salyut 5 station 20 in addition excalibur almaz acquired four va return capsule hulls derived from the tks va spacecraft and plans to outfit and launch them as well one is planned to be used in support of space tourism while the other three capsules are reserved for scientific and commercial payloads the needed development of propulsion systems for the va capsule was reportedly delegated to an unnamed european organization as early as 2009.[17 excalibur almaz has as of january 2012[update postponed its first launch to 2015 to be able to include more lucrative deep space capabilities like
