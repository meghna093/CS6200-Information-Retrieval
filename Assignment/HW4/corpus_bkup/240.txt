cloud seeding  wikipediathis article is about weather modification it is not to be confused with chemtrail conspiracy theory this image explaining cloud seeding shows the chemical either silver iodide or dry ice being dumped onto the cloud which then becomes a rain shower the process shown in the upper-right is what is happening in the cloud and the process of condensation to the introduced chemicals 1 cloud seeding is a form of weather modification a way of changing the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud the usual intent is to increase precipitation rain or snow but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports cloud seeding also occurs due to ice nucleators in nature most of which are bacterial in origin 2 methodology the most common chemicals used for cloud seeding include silver iodide potassium iodide and dry ice solid carbon dioxide liquid propane which expands into a gas has also been used this can produce ice crystals at higher temperatures than silver iodide after promising research the use of hygroscopic materials such as table salt is becoming more popular 3 when cloud seeding increased snowfall takes place when temperatures within the clouds are between 19 and 4 f 7 and 20 c 4 introduction of a substance such as silver iodide which has a crystalline structure similar to that of ice will induce freezing nucleation in mid-altitude clouds the usual seeding strategy has been based on the fact that the equilibrium vapor pressure is lower over ice than over water the formation of ice particles in supercooled clouds allows those particles to grow at the expense of liquid droplets if sufficient growth takes place the particles become heavy enough to fall as precipitation from clouds that otherwise would produce no precipitation this process is known as static seeding seeding of warm-season or tropical convective clouds seeks to exploit the latent heat released by freezing this strategy of dynamic seeding assumes that the additional latent heat adds buoyancy strengthens updrafts ensures more low-level convergence and ultimately causes rapid growth of properly selected clouds cloud seeding chemicals may be dispersed by aircraft or by dispersion devices located on the ground generators or canisters fired from anti-aircraft guns or rockets for release by aircraft silver iodide flares are ignited and dispersed as an aircraft flies through the inflow of a cloud when released by devices on the ground the fine particles are carried downwind and upward by air currents after release an electronic mechanism was tested in 2010 when infrared laser pulses were directed to the air above berlin by researchers from the university of geneva 5 the experimenters posited that the pulses would encourage atmospheric sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide to form particles that would then act as seeds 5 effectiveness cloud seeding has never been statistically proven to work an ecologist at stanford university says i think you can squeeze out a little more snow or rain in some places under some conditions but that's quite different from a program claiming to reliably increase precipitation 6 claims are made that new technology and research has produced reliable results that make cloud seeding a dependable and affordable water supply practice for many regions 7 but while practiced widely around the world the effectiveness of cloud seeding is still a matter of academic debate 8 in 2003 the us national research council nrc released a report stating  science is unable to say with assurance which if any seeding techniques produce positive effects in the 55 years following the first cloud-seeding demonstrations substantial progress has been made in understanding the natural processes that account for our daily weather yet scientifically acceptable proof for significant seeding effects has not been achieved 9]:13 referring to 1903 1915 1919 1944 and 1947 weather modification experiments the australian federation of meteorology discounted rain making by the 1950s the csiro division of radiophysics switched to investigating the physics of clouds and had hoped by 1957 to better understand these processes by the 1960s the dreams of weather making had faded only to be re-ignited post-corporatisation of the snowy mountains scheme in order to achieve above target water this would provide enhanced energy generation and profits to the public agencies that are the principal owners recently in 2017 this process had been used by the uae for it had been forecasted that it won't rain for the whole year in the uae cloud seeding has been shown to be effective in altering cloud structure and size and in converting supercooled liquid water to ice particles the amount of precipitation due to seeding is difficult to quantify there is statistical evidence for seasonal precipitation increases of about 10 percent with winter seeding 10 clouds were seeded during the 2008 summer olympics in beijing using rockets to coax rain showers out of clouds before they reached the olympic city so that there would be no rain during the opening and closing ceremonies 11 although others dispute their claims of success 12 a 2010 tel aviv university study claimed that the common practice of cloud seeding to improve rainfall with materials such as silver iodide and frozen carbon dioxide seems to have little if any impact on the amount of precipitation 13 a 2011 study suggested that airplanes may produce ice particles by freezing cloud droplets that cool as they flow around the tips of propellers over wings or over jet aircraft and thereby unintentionally seed clouds this could have potentially serious consequences for particular hail stone formation 14 impact on environment and health with an nfpa 704 health hazard rating of 2 silver iodide can cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury to humans and mammals with intense or chronic exposure however there have been several detailed ecological studies that showed negligible environmental and health impacts 15]   wmo this prize was thereafter reshaped into the international research program for rain enhancement science it subsequently became the uae
