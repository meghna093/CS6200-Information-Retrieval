arabic has consonants traditionally termed emphatic t d s         which exhibit simultaneous pharyngealization t d s  as well as varying degrees of velarization t d s  so they may be written with the velarized or pharyngealized diacritic    as t d s  this simultaneous articulation is described as retracted tongue root by phonologists 51 in some transcription systems emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter for example d is written d in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it for example  vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long long geminate consonants are normally written doubled in latin transcription i e bb dd etc  reflecting the presence of the arabic diacritic mark shaddah which indicates doubled consonants in actual pronunciation doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants this consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive  qabila he accepted vs  qabbala he kissed proto semitic ipa arabic written standard

syllables open syllables cv and cvv and closed syllables cvc cvvc and cvcc the syllable types with two morae units of time i e cvc and cvv are termed heavy syllables while those with three morae i e cvvc and cvcc are superheavy syllables superheavy syllables in classical arabic occur in only two places at the end of the sentence due to pausal pronunciation and in words such as  rr hot  mddah stuff substance  tajj they disputed with each other where a long  occurs before two identical consonants a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost in less formal pronunciations of modern standard arabic superheavy syllables are common at the end of words or before clitic suffixes such as n us our due to the deletion of final short vowels  in surface pronunciation every vowel must be preceded by a consonant which may include the glottal stop  there are no cases of hiatus within a word where two vowels occur next to each other without an intervening consonant some words do have an underlying vowel at the beginning such as the definite article al or words such as  ishtar he bought  ijtim meeting when actually pronounced one of three things happens if the word occurs after another word ending in a consonant there is a smooth transition from final consonant to initial vowel e g  al-ijtim meeting alidtima if the word occurs after another word ending in a vowel the initial vowel of the word is elided e g   baytu a l-mudr house of the director bajtulmudir if the word occurs at the beginning of an utterance a glottal stop  is added onto the beginning e g   al-baytu huwa the house is  albajtuhuwa  stress word stress is not phonemically contrastive in standard arabic it bears a strong relationship to vowel length the basic rules for modern standard arabic are a final vowel long or short may not be stressed only one of the last three syllables may be stressed given this restriction the last heavy syllable containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant is stressed if it is not the final syllable if the final syllable is super heavy and closed of the form cvvc or cvcc it receives stress if no syllable is heavy or super heavy the first possible syllable i e third from end is stressed as a special exception in form vii and viii verb forms stress may not be on the first syllable despite the above rules hence inkatab a he subscribed whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced yankatib u he subscribes whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced yankatib he should subscribe juss  likewise form viii ishtar he bought yashtar he

normal situation where they are not pronounced as in the above example of mak-ta-ba-tun library in full pronunciation but mak-ta-ba -tun library in short pronunciation the restriction on final long vowels does not apply to the spoken dialects where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen from loss of original final hu hi some dialects have different stress rules in the cairo egyptian arabic dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word hence mad-ra-sah school q-hi-rah cairo this also affects the way that modern standard arabic is pronounced in egypt in the arabic of sanaa stress is often retracted bay-tayn two houses m-sat-hum their table ma-k-tb desks z-rat-n sometimes mad-ra-sat-hum their school in this dialect only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy in a two-syllable word the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light and in longer words the final syllable cannot be stressed  levels of pronunciation the final short vowels e g the case endings a i u and mood endings u a are often not pronounced in this language despite forming part of the formal paradigm of nouns and verbs the following levels of pronunciation exist full pronunciation with pausa this is the most formal level actually used in speech all endings are pronounced as written except at the end of an utterance where the following changes occur final short vowels are not pronounced but possibly an exception is made for feminine plural na and shortened vowels in the jussive imperative of defective verbs e g irmi throw  the entire indefinite noun endings in and un with nunation are left off the ending an is left off of nouns preceded by a t marbah  i e the t in the ending at that typically marks feminine nouns but pronounced as  in other nouns hence its writing in this fashion in the arabic script the t marbah itself typically of feminine nouns is pronounced as h at least this is the case in extremely formal pronunciation e g some quranic recitations in practice this h is usually omitted  formal short pronunciation this is a formal level of pronunciation sometimes seen it is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position with influence from the colloquial varieties the following changes occur most final short vowels are not pronounced however the following short vowels are pronounced feminine plural na shortened vowels in the jussive imperative of defective verbs e g irmi throw second-person singular feminine past-tense ti and likewise anti you fem sg  sometimes first-person singular past-tense tu sometimes second-person masculine past-tense ta and likewise anta you masc sg  final a in certain short words e g laysa is not sawfa future-tense marker the nunation endings an in un are not pronounced however they are pronounced in adverbial accusative formations e g taqrban  almost approximately datan  usually the t marbah ending  is unpronounced except in construct state nouns where it sounds as t and in adverbial accusative constructions e g datan  usually where the entire tan is pronounced the masculine singular nisbah ending iyy is actually pronounced  and is unstressed but plural and feminine singular forms i e when followed by a suffix still sound as iyy full endings including case endings occur when a clitic object or possessive suffix is added e g n us our informal short pronunciation this is the pronunciation used by speakers of modern standard arabic in extemporaneous speech i e when producing new sentences rather than simply reading a prepared text it is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply even when a clitic suffix is added basically short-vowel case and mood endings are never pronounced and certain other changes occur that echo the corresponding colloquial pronunciations specifically all the rules for formal short pronunciation apply except as follows the past tense singular endings written formally as tu ta ti are pronounced t t ti but masculine anta is pronounced in full unlike in formal short pronunciation the rules for dropping or modifying final endings are also applied when a clitic object or possessive suffix is added e g n us our if this produces a sequence of three consonants then one of the following happens depending on the speaker's native colloquial variety a short vowel e g i or  is consistently added either between the second and third or the first and second consonants or a short vowel is added only if an otherwise unpronounceable sequence occurs typically due to a violation of the sonority hierarchy e g rtn is pronounced as a three-consonant cluster but trn needs to be broken up or a short vowel is never added but consonants like r l m n occurring between two other consonants will be pronounced as a syllabic consonant as in the english words butter bottle bottom button when a doubled consonant occurs before another consonant or finally it is often shortened to a single consonant rather than a vowel added but note that moroccan arabic never shortens doubled consonants or inserts short vowels to break up clusters instead tolerating arbitrary-length series of arbitrary consonants and hence moroccan arabic speakers are likely to follow the same rules in their pronunciation of modern standard arabic  the clitic suffixes themselves tend also to be changed in a way that avoids many possible occurrences of three-consonant clusters in particular ka ki hu generally sound as ak ik uh final long vowels are often shortened merging with any short vowels that remain depending on the level of formality the speaker's education level etc various grammatical changes may occur in ways that echo the colloquial variants any remaining case endings e g masculine plural nominative n vs oblique n will be leveled with the oblique form used everywhere however in words like ab father and akh brother with special long-vowel case endings in the construct state the nominative is used everywhere hence ab father of akh brother of  feminine plural endings in verbs and clitic suffixes will often drop out with the masculine plural endings used instead if the speaker's native variety has feminine plural endings they may be preserved but will often be modified in the direction of the forms used in the speaker's native variety e g an instead of na dual endings will often drop out except on nouns and then used only for emphasis similar to their use in the colloquial varieties elsewhere the plural endings are used or feminine singular if appropriate colloquial varieties further information varieties of arabic vowels as mentioned above many spoken dialects have a process of emphasis spreading where the emphasis pharyngealization of emphatic consonants spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone   in all nearby low vowels the extent of emphasis spreading varies for example in moroccan arabic it spreads as far as the first full vowel i e sound derived from a long vowel or diphthong on either side in many levantine dialects it spreads indefinitely but is blocked by any j or  while in egyptian arabic it usually spreads throughout the entire word including prefixes and suffixes in moroccan arabic i u also have emphatic allophones e~ and o~ respectively unstressed short vowels especially i u are deleted in many contexts many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred especially a  i and interchange i  u most levantine dialects merge short i u into  in most contexts all except directly before a single final consonant in moroccan arabic on the other hand short u triggers labialization of nearby consonants especially velar consonants and uvular consonants and then short a i u all merge into  which is deleted in many contexts the labialization plus  is sometimes interpreted as an underlying phoneme   this essentially causes the wholesale loss of the short-long vowel distinction with the original long vowels a i u remaining as half-long a i u phonemically a i u which are used to represent both short and long vowels in borrowings from literary arabic most spoken dialects have monophthongized original aj aw to e o in all circumstances including adjacent to emphatic consonants in moroccan arabic these have subsequently merged into original i u consonants in some dialects there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above for example non-arabic v is used in the maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names semitic p became f extremely early on in arabic before it was written down a few modern arabic dialects such as iraqi influenced by persian and kurdish distinguish between p and b the iraqi arabic also uses sounds  t and uses persian adding letters e g  gawjah  a plum  chimah  a truffle and so on early in the expansion of arabic the separate emphatic phonemes  and  coalesced into a single phoneme  many dialects such as egyptian levantine and much of the maghreb subsequently lost interdental fricatives converting    into t d d most dialects borrow learned words from the standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words but some dialects without interdental fricatives particularly in egypt and the levant render original    d in borrowed words as s z z d another key distinguishing mark of arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives q d proto-semitic  and k  q retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as yemen morocco and urban areas of the maghreb it is pronounced as a glottal stop  in several prestige dialects such as those spoken in cairo beirut and damascus but it is rendered as a voiced velar plosive  in persian gulf upper egypt parts of the maghreb and less urban parts of the levant e g jordan in iraqi arabic it sometimes retains its original pronunciation and is sometimes rendered as a voiced velar plosive depending on the word some traditionally christian villages in rural areas of the levant render the sound as k as do shii bahrainis in some gulf dialects it is palatalized to d or  it is pronounced as a voiced uvular constrictive  in sudanese arabic many dialects with a modified pronunciation for q maintain the q pronunciation in certain words often with religious or educational overtones borrowed from the classical language  d is pronounced as an affricate in iraq and much of the arabian peninsula but is pronounced  in most of north egypt and parts of yemen and oman  in morocco tunisia and the levant and j i in most words in much of the persian gulf  k usually retains its original pronunciation but is palatalized to t in many words in israel and the palestinian territories iraq and much of the arabian peninsula often a distinction is made between the suffixes ak you masc  and ik you fem  which become ak and it respectively in sana'a omani and bahrani ik is pronounced i pharyngealization of the emphatic consonants tends to weaken in many of the spoken varieties and to spread from emphatic consonants to nearby sounds in addition the emphatic allophone  automatically triggers pharyngealization of adjacent sounds in many dialects as a result it may difficult or impossible to determine whether a given coronal consonant is phonemically emphatic or not especially in dialects with long-distance emphasis spreading a notable exception is the sounds t vs t in moroccan arabic because the former is pronounced as an affricate ts but the latter is not  grammar examples of how the arabic root and form system works main article arabic grammar literary arabic main article modern standard arabic as in other semitic languages arabic has a complex and unusual morphology i e method of constructing words from a basic root arabic has a nonconcatenative root-and-pattern morphology a root consists of a set of bare consonants usually three which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words for example the word for i wrote is constructed by combining the root k-t-b write with the pattern a-a-tu i xed to form katabtu i wrote other verbs meaning i xed will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants e g qaratu i read akaltu i ate dhahabtu i went although other patterns are possible e g sharibtu i drank qultu i said takallamtu i spoke where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix tu is always used from a single root k-t-b numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns katabtu i wrote kattabtu i had something written ktabtu i corresponded with someone aktabtu i dictated iktatabtu i subscribed taktabn we corresponded with each other aktubu i write ukattibu i have something written uktibu i correspond with someone uktibu i dictate aktatibu i subscribe nataktabu we correspond each other kotiba it was written uktiba it was dictated maktoub written muktab dictated kitb book kotub books ktib writer kuttb writers maktab desk office maktabah library bookshop etc nouns and adjectives nouns in literary arabic have three grammatical cases nominative accusative and genitive also used when the noun is governed by a preposition three numbers singular dual and plural two genders masculine and feminine and three states indefinite definite and construct the cases of singular nouns other than those that end in long  are indicated by suffixed short vowels u for nominative a for accusative i for genitive the feminine singular is often marked by at which is reduced to ah or a before a pause plural is indicated either through endings the sound plural or internal modification the broken plural definite nouns include all proper nouns all nouns in construct state and all nouns which are prefixed by the definite article al indefinite singular nouns other than those that end in long  add a final n to the case-marking vowels giving un an or in which is also referred to as nunation or tanwn adjectives in literary arabic are marked for case number gender and state as for nouns however the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective which takes the ah or at suffix pronouns in literary arabic are marked for person number and gender there are two varieties independent pronouns and enclitics enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns the first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs ni and for nouns or prepositions  after consonants ya after vowels nouns verbs pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects however non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular furthermore a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun numerals between three and ten show chiasmic agreement in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa verbs verbs in literary arabic are marked for person first second or third gender and number they are conjugated in two major paradigms past and non-past two voices active and passive and six moods indicative imperative subjunctive jussive shorter energetic and longer energetic the fifth and sixth moods the energetics exist only in classical arabic but not in msa 54 there are also two participles active and passive and a verbal noun but no infinitive the past and non-past paradigms are sometimes also termed perfective and imperfective indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of tense and aspect the moods other than the indicative occur only in the non-past and the future tense is signaled by prefixing sa or sawfa onto the non-past the past and non-past differ in the form of the stem e g past katab vs non-past ktub and also use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person number and gender in the past the person number and gender are fused into a single suffixal morpheme while in the non-past a combination of prefixes primarily encoding person and suffixes primarily encoding gender and number are used the passive voice uses the same person number gender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem the following shows a paradigm of a regular arabic verb kataba to write note that in modern standard the energetic mood in either long or short form which have the same meaning is almost never used derivation like other semitic languages and unlike most other languages arabic makes much more use of nonconcatenative morphology applying a large number of templates applied roots to derive words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words for verbs a given root can occur in many different derived verb stems of which there are about fifteen each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past stems active and passive participles and verbal noun these are referred to by western scholars as form i form ii and so on through form xv although forms xi to xv are rare these stems encode grammatical functions such as the causative intensive and reflexive stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs albeit often semantically related and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm as a result these derived stems are part of the system of derivational morphology not part of the inflectional system examples of the different verbs formed from the root k-t-b write using -m-r red for form ix which is limited to colors and physical defects most of these forms are exclusively classical arabic form past meaning non-past meaning i kataba he wrote yaktubu he writes ii kattaba he made someone write yukattibu he makes someone write iii ktaba he corresponded with wrote to someone yuktibu he corresponds with writes to someone iv aktaba he dictated yuktibu he dictates v takattaba nonexistent yatakattabu nonexistent vi taktaba he corresponded with someone esp mutually yataktabu he

someone to write yastaktibu he asks someone to write form ii is sometimes used to create transitive denominative verbs verbs built from nouns form v is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives the associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in arabic this is similar to the process by which for example the english gerund meeting similar to a verbal noun has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social often work-related event where people gather together to have a discussion another lexicalized verbal noun another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots such as the nouns of location in ma e g maktab desk office  k-t-b write mabakh kitchen  -b-kh cook the only three genuine suffixes are as follows the feminine suffix ah variously derives terms for women from related terms for men or more generally terms along the same lines as the corresponding masculine e g maktabah library also a writing-related place but different from maktab as above the nisbah suffix iyy this suffix is extremely productive and forms adjectives meaning related to x it corresponds to english adjectives in ic al an y ist etc the feminine nisbah suffix iyyah this is formed by adding the feminine suffix ah onto nisba adjectives to form abstract nouns for example from the basic root sh-r-k share can be derived the form viii verb ishtaraka to cooperate participate and in turn its verbal noun ishtirk cooperation participation can be formed this in turn can be made into a nisbah adjective ishtirk socialist from which an abstract noun ishtirkiyyah socialism can be derived other recent formations are jumhriyyah republic lit public-ness  jumhr multitude general public and the gaddafi-specific variation jamhriyyah people's republic lit masses-ness  jamhr the masses pl of jumhr as above colloquial varieties main article varieties of arabic the spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances they have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes most often bi for indicative vs unmarked subjunctive they have also mostly lost the indefinite nunation and the internal passive the following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in egyptian arabic example of a regular form i verb in egyptian arabic ktab yktib write tense mood

a rough draft the arabic alphabet derives from the aramaic through nabatean to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of coptic or cyrillic scripts to greek script traditionally there were several differences between the western north african and middle eastern versions of the alphabetin particular the fa had a dot underneath and qaf a single dot above in the maghreb and the order of the letters was slightly different at least when they were used as numerals however the old maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the maghreb itself and remains in use mainly in the quranic schools zaouias of west africa arabic like all other semitic languages except for the latin-written maltese and the languages with the ge'ez script is written from right to left there are several styles of script notably naskh which is used in print and by computers and ruqah which is commonly used in handwriting 55 calligraphy main article islamic calligraphy after khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi finally fixed the arabic script around 786 many styles were developed both for the writing down of the quran and other books and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the western world and is still considered by arabs as a major art form calligraphers are held in great esteem being cursive by nature unlike the latin script arabic script is used to write down a verse of the quran a hadith or simply a proverb the composition is often abstract but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal one of the current masters of the genre is hassan massoudy in modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language necessary for digitized unification will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy 56 romanization main article

text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world such as personal computers the world wide web email bulletin board systems irc instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin script only and some of them still do not have the arabic script as an optional feature as a result arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script sometimes known as im arabic to handle those arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the latin script numerals and other characters were appropriated for example the numeral 3 may be used to represent the arabic letter  there is no universal name for this type of transliteration but some have named it arabic chat alphabet other systems of transliteration exist such as using dots or capitalization to represent the emphatic counterparts of certain consonants for instance using capitalization the letter  may be represented by d its emphatic counterpart  may be written as d numerals in most of present-day north africa the western arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are used however in egypt and arabic-speaking countries to the east of it the eastern arabic numerals                    are in use when representing a number in arabic the lowest-valued position is placed on the right so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right but numbers are spoken in the traditional arabic fashion with units and tens reversed from the modern english usage for example 24 is said four and twenty just like in the german language vierundzwanzig and classical hebrew and 1975 is said a

settings historically arab linguists considered the arabic language to be superior to all other languages and took almost no interest in learning any language other than arabic[citation needed with the sole example of medieval linguist abu hayyan al-gharnati  who while a scholar of the arabic language was not ethnically arab  scholars of the arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics considering all other languages inferior 59 in modern times the educated upper classes in the arab world have taken a nearly opposite view yasir suleiman wrote in 2011 that studying and knowing english or french in most of the middle east and north africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and feigning or asserting weakness or lack of facility in arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status class and perversely even education through a mlange of code-switching practises 60 arab-american professor franck salamah went as far as to declare arabic a dead language conveying dead ideas blaming its stagnation for arab intellectual stagnation and lamenting that great writers in arabic are judged by their command of the language and not the merit of
