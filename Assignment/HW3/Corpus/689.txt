mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones are low-pressure areas which along with the anticyclones of high-pressure areas drive the weather over much of the earth extratropical cyclones are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales thunderstorms blizzards and tornadoes these types of cyclones are defined as large scale synoptic low pressure weather systems that occur in the middle latitudes of the earth in contrast with tropical cyclones extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and dew point along broad lines called weather fronts about the center of the cyclone 1 terminology play media this animation shows an extratropical cyclone developing over the united states starting late on october 25 and running through october 27 2010 the term cyclone applies to numerous types of low pressure areas one of which is the extratropical cyclone the descriptor extratropical signifies that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside the tropics and in the middle latitudes of earth between 30 and 60 latitude they are termed mid-latitude cyclones if they form within those latitudes or post-tropical cyclones if a tropical cyclone has intruded into the mid latitudes 1]         [52 climate and general circulation in the classic analysis by edward lorenz the lorenz energy cycle 53 extratropical cyclones so-called atmospheric transients acts as a mechanism in converting potential energy that is created by pole to equator temperature gradients to eddy kinetic energy in the process the pole-equator temperature gradient is reduced i e energy is transported poleward to warm up the higher latitudes the existence of such transients are also closely related to the formation of the icelandic and aleutian low  the two most prominent general circulation features in the mid to sub-polar northern latitudes 54 the two lows are formed by both the transport of kinetic energy and the latent heating the energy released when water phase changed from vapor to liquid during precipitation from the extratropical cyclones historic storms cyclone oratia showing typical comma shape of extratropical cyclone over europe in october 2000 a violent storm during the crimean war on november 14 1854 wrecked 30 vessels and sparked initial investigations into meteorology and forecasting in europe in the united states the columbus day storm of 1962 one of many pacific northwest windstorms led to oregon's lowest measured pressure of 965.5 hpa 96.55 kpa 28.51 inhg violent winds and us 170 million in damage 1964 dollars 55 the wahine storm was an extratropical cyclone that struck wellington new zealand on april 10 1968 so named after causing the inter-island ferry tev wahine to strike a reef and founder at the entrance to wellington harbour resulting in 53 deaths on november 10 1975 an extratropical storm on lake superior contributed to the sinking of the ss edmund fitzgerald near the canadaus border 15 nm northwest of the entrance to whitefish bay 56 a rapidly strengthening storm struck vancouver island on october 11 1984 and inspired the development of moored buoys off the western coast of canada 57 the braer storm of january 1993 was the strongest extratropical cyclone known to occur across the northern atlantic ocean with a central pressure of 914 millibars 27.0 inhg 58 in 2012 hurricane sandy transitioned to a post-tropical cyclone on the night of october 29 a few minutes later it made landfall on the new jersey coast as an extratropical storm with winds similar to a category 1 hurricane and a wind field of over 1,150 miles 1,850 km in the southern hemisphere a violent extratropical storm hit uruguay on august 2324 2005 killing 10 people 59 the system's winds exceeded 100 mph 160 km h while montevideo the country's capital with 1.5 million inhabitants was affected by tropical storm-force winds for over 12 hours and by hurricane-force winds for nearly four hours 60 peak gusts were registered at carrasco international airport as 107 mph 172 km h and at the harbour of montevideo as 116 mph 187 km h the lowest reported pressure was 991.7 hpa 99.17 kpa 29.28 inhg extratropical cyclones are common in this part of the globe during fall winter and spring months the winds usually peak to 80110 km h 5068 mph and winds of 116 mph 187 km h are very uncommon 60 see also weather
