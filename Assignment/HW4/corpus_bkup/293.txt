typhon  wikipediathis article is about typhon in greek mythology for other uses see typhon disambiguation typhon tafn fn greek  tuphn typn also typhoeus tafis  tupheus typhaon  tuphan or typhos  tuphs was a monstrous serpentine giant and the most deadly creature in greek mythology according to hesiod typhon was the son of gaia and tartarus however one source has typhon as the son of hera alone while another makes typhon the offspring of cronus typhon and his mate echidna were the progenitors of many famous monsters typhon attempted to overthrow zeus for the supremacy of the cosmos the two fought a cataclysmic battle which zeus finally won with the aid of his thunderbolts defeated typhon was cast into tartarus or buried underneath mount etna or the island of ischia typhon mythology is part of the greek succession myth which explained how zeus came to rule the gods typhon's story is also connected with that of python the serpent killed by apollo and both stories probably derived from several near eastern antecedents typhon was from c 500 bc also identified with the egyptian god of destruction set in later accounts typhon was often confused with the giants mythology birth according to hesiod's theogony c 8th  7th century bc typhon was the son of gaia earth and tartarus when zeus had driven the titans from heaven huge earth bore her youngest child typhoeus of the love of tartarus by the aid of golden aphrodite 2 the mythographer apollodorus 1st or 2nd century ad adds that gaia bore typhon in anger at the gods for their destruction of her offspring the giants 3 numerous other sources mention typhon as being the offspring of gaia or simply earth-born with no mention of tartarus 4 however according to the homeric hymn to apollo 6th century bc typhon was the child of hera alone 5 hera angry at zeus for having given birth to athena by himself prayed to gaia uranus and the titans to give her a son stronger than zeus then slapped the ground and became pregnant hera gave the infant typhon to the serpent python to raise and typhon grew up to become a great bane to mortals 6 depiction by wenceslas hollar several sources locate typhon's birth and dwelling place in cilicia and in particular the region in the vicinity of the ancient cilician coastal city of corycus modern kzkalesi turkey the poet pindar c 470 bc calls typhon cilician 7 and says that typhon was born in cilicia and nurtured in the famous cilician cave 8 an apparent allusion to the corycian cave in turkey 9 in aeschylus prometheus bound typhon is called the dweller of the cilician caves 10 and both apollodorus and the poet nonnus 4th or 5th century ad have typhon born in cilicia 11 the b scholia to iliad 2.783 preserving a possibly orphic tradition has typhon born in cilicia as the offspring of cronus gaia angry at the destruction of the giants slanders zeus to hera so hera goes to zeus father cronus whom zeus had overthrown and cronus gives hera two eggs smeared with his own semen telling her to bury them and that from them would be born one who would overthrow zeus hera angry at zeus buries the eggs in cilicia under arimon but when typhon is born hera now reconciled with zeus informs him 12 descriptions according to hesiod typhon was terrible outrageous and lawless 13 immensely powerful and on his shoulders were one hundred snake heads that emitted fire and every kind of noise strength was with his hands in all that he did and the feet of the strong god were untiring from his shoulders grew a hundred heads of a snake a fearful dragon with dark flickering tongues and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads flashed fire and fire burned from his heads as he glared and there were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of sound unspeakable for at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood but at another the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud ungovernable fury and at another the sound of a lion relentless of heart and at another sounds like whelps wonderful to hear and again at another he would hiss so that the high mountains re-echoed 14 the homeric hymn to apollo describes typhon as fell and cruel and neither like gods nor men 15 three of pindar's poems have typhon as hundred-headed as in hesiod 16 while apparently a fourth gives him only fifty heads 17 but a hundred heads for typhon became standard 18 a chalcidian hydria c 540530 bc depicts typhon as a winged humanoid from the waist up with two snake tails below 19 aeschylus calls typhon fire-breathing 20 for nicander 2nd century bc typhon was a monster of enormous strength and strange appearance with many heads hands and wings and with huge snake coils coming from his thighs 21 apollodorus describes typhon as a huge winged monster whose head brushed the stars human in form above the waist with snake coils below and fire flashing from his eyes in size and strength he surpassed all the offspring of earth as far as the thighs he was of human shape and of such prodigious bulk that he out-topped all the mountains and his head often brushed the stars one of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the east and from them projected a hundred dragons heads from the thighs downward he had huge coils of vipers which when drawn out reached to his very head and emitted a loud hissing his body was all winged unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his head and cheeks and fire flashed from his eyes the most elaborate description of typhon is found in nonnus's dionysiaca nonnus makes numerous references to typhon's serpentine nature 22 giving him a tangled army of snakes 23 snaky feet 24 and hair 25 according to nonnus typhon was a poison-spitting viper 26 whose every hair belched viper-poison 27 and typhon spat out showers of poison from his throat the mountain torrents were swollen as the monster showered fountains from the viperish bristles of his high head 28 and the water-snakes of the monster's viperish feet crawl into the caverns underground spitting poison 29 following hesiod and others nonnus gives typhon many heads though untotaled but in addition to snake heads 30 nonnus also gives typhon many other animal heads including leopards lions bulls boars bears cattle wolves and dogs which combine to make the cries of all wild beasts together 31 and a babel of screaming sounds 32 nonnus also gives typhon legions of arms innumerable 33 and where nicander had only said that typhon had many hands and ovid had given typhon a hundred hands nonnus gives typhon two hundred 34 offspring according to hesiod's theogony typhon was joined in love to echidna a monstrous half-woman and half-snake who bore typhon fierce offspring 35 first according to hesiod there was orthrus 36 the two-headed dog who guarded the cattle of geryon second cerberus 37 the multiheaded dog who guarded the gates of hades and third the lernaean hydra 38 the many-headed serpent who when one of its heads was cut off grew two more the theogony next mentions an ambiguous she which might refer to echidna as the mother of the chimera a fire-breathing beast that was part lion part goat and had a snake-headed tail with typhon then being the father 39 while mentioning cerberus and other monsters as being the offspring of echidna and typhon the mythographer acusilaus 6th century bc adds the caucasian eagle that ate the liver of prometheus 40 the mythographer pherecydes of leros 5th century bc also names prometheus eagle 41 and adds ladon though pherecydes does not use this name and the dragon that guarded the golden apples in the garden of the hesperides according to hesiod the offspring of ceto and phorcys 42 the lyric poet lasus of hermione 6th century bc adds the sphinx 43 later authors mostly retain these offspring of typhon by echidna while adding others apollodorus in addition to naming as their offspring orthrus the chimera citing hesiod as his source the caucasian eagle ladon and the sphinx also adds the nemean lion no mother is given and the crommyonian sow killed by the hero theseus unmentioned by hesiod 44 hyginus 1st century bc 45 in his list of offspring of typhon all by echidna retains from the above cerberus the chimera the sphinx the hydra and ladon and adds gorgon by which hyginus means the mother of medusa whereas hesiod's three gorgons of which medusa was one were the daughters of ceto and phorcys the colchian dragon that guarded the golden fleece[46 and scylla 47 the harpies in hesiod the daughters of thaumas and the oceanid electra 48 in one source are said to be the daughters of typhon 49 the sea serpents which attacked the trojan priest laocon during the trojan war were perhaps supposed to be the progeny of typhon and echidna 50 according to hesiod the defeated typhon is the source of destructive storm winds 51 battle with zeus typhon challenged zeus for rule of the cosmos 52 the earliest mention of typhon and his only occurrence in homer is a passing reference in the iliad to zeus striking the ground around where typhon lies defeated 53 hesiod's theogony gives us the first account of their battle according to hesiod without the quick action of zeus typhon would have come to reign over mortals and immortals 54 in the theogony zeus and typhon meet in cataclysmic conflict zeus thundered hard and mightily and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above and the sea and ocean's streams and the nether parts of the earth great olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat and through the two of them heat took hold on the dark-blue sea through the thunder and lightning and through the fire from the monster and the scorching winds and blazing thunderbolt the whole earth seethed and sky and sea and the long waves raged along the beaches round and about at the rush of the deathless gods and there arose an endless shaking hades trembled where he rules over the dead below and the titans under tartarus who live with cronos because of the unending clamor and the fearful strife 55 zeus with his thunderbolt easily overcomes typhon 56 who is thrown down to earth in a fiery crash so when zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt he leaped from olympus and struck him and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him but when zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes typhoeus was hurled down a maimed wreck so that the huge earth groaned and flame shot forth from the thunderstricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount when he was smitten a great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapor and melted as tin melts when heated by men's art in channelled crucibles or as iron which is hardest of all things is shortened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of hephaestus even so then the earth melted in the glow of the blazing fire 57 defeated typhon is cast into tartarus by an angry zeus 58 epimenides 7th or 6th century bc seemingly knew a different version of the story in which typhon enters zeus palace while zeus is asleep but zeus awakes and kills typhon with a thunderbolt 59 pindar apparently knew of a tradition which had the gods in order to escape from typhon transform themselves into animals and flee to egypt 60 pindar calls typhon the enemy of the gods 61 and says that he was defeated by zeus thunderbolt 62 in one poem pindar has typhon being held prisoner by zeus under etna 63 and in another says that typhon lies in dread tartarus stretched out underground between mount etna and cumae 64 in aeschylus prometheus bound a hissing typhon his eyes flashing withstood all the gods but the unsleeping bolt of zeus struck him and he was burnt to ashes and his strength blasted from him by the lightning bolt 65 according to pherecydes of leros during his battle with zeus typhon first flees to the caucasus which begins to burn then to the volcanic island of pithecussae modern ischia off the coast of cumae where he is buried under the island 66 apollonius of rhodes 3rd century bc like pherecydes presents a multi-stage battle with typhon being struck by zeus thunderbolt on mount caucasus before fleeing to the mountains and plain of nysa and ending up as already mentioned by the fifth-century bc greek historian herodotus buried under lake serbonis in egypt 67 like pindar nicander has all the gods but zeus and athena transform into animal forms and flee to egypt apollo became a hawk hermes an ibis ares a fish artemis a cat dionysus a goat heracles a fawn hephaestus an ox and leto a mouse 68 the geographer strabo c 20 ad gives several locations which were associated with the battle according to strabo typhon was said to have cut the serpentine channel of the orontes river which flowed beneath the syrian mount kasios modern jebel aqra while fleeing from zeus 69 and some placed the battle at catacecaumene burnt land 70 a volcanic plain on the upper gediz river between the ancient kingdoms of lydia mysia and phrygia near mount tmolus modern bozda and sardis the ancient capital of lydia 71 in the versions of the battle given by hesiod aeschylus and pindar zeus defeat of typhon is straightforward however a more involved version of the battle is given by apollodorus 72 no early source gives any reason for the conflict but apollodorus account seemingly implies that typhon had been produced by gaia to avenge the destruction by zeus and the other gods of the giants a previous generation of offspring of gaia according to apollodorus typhon hurling kindled rocks attacked the gods with hissings and shouts spouting a great jet of fire from his mouth  seeing this the gods transformed into animals and fled to egypt as in pindar and nicander however zeus pelted typhon at a distance with thunderbolts and at close quarters struck him down with an adamantine sickle [73 wounded typhon fled to the syrian mount kasios where zeus grappled with him but typhon twining his snaky coils around zeus was able to wrest away the sickle and cut the sinews from zeus hands and feet typhon carried the disabled zeus across the sea to the corycian cave in cilicia where he set the she-serpent delphyne to guard over zeus and his severed sinews which typhon had hidden in a bearskin but hermes and aegipan possibly another name for pan [74 stole the sinews and gave them back to zeus his strength restored zeus chased typhon to mount nysa where the moirai tricked typhon into eating ephemeral fruits which weakened him typhon then fled to thrace where he threw mountains at zeus which were turned back on him by zeus thunderbolts and the mountain where typhon stood being drenched with typhon's blood became known as mount haemus bloody mountain typhon then fled to sicily where zeus threw mount etna on top of typhon burying him and so finally defeated him oppian 2nd century ad says that pan helped zeus in the battle by tricking typhon to come out from his lair and into the open by the promise of a banquet of fish thus enabling zeus to defeat typhon with his thunderbolts 75 nonnus's dionysiaca the longest and most involved version of the battle appears in nonnus's dionysiaca late 4th or early 5th century ad 76 zeus hides his thunderbolts in a cave so that he might seduce the maiden plouto and so produce tantalus but smoke rising from the thunderbolts enables typhon under the guidance of gaia to locate zeus's weapons steal them and hide them in another cave 77 immediately typhon extends his clambering hands into the upper air and begins a long and concerted attack upon the heavens 78 then leaving the air he turns his attack upon the seas 79 finally typhon attempts to wield zeus thunderbolts but they felt the hands of a novice and all their manly blaze was unmanned 80 now zeus sinews had somehow  nonnus does not say how or when  fallen to the ground during their battle and typhon had taken them also 81 but zeus devises a plan with cadmus and pan to beguile typhon 82 cadmus desguised as a shepherd enchants typhon by playing the panpipes and typhon entrusting the thuderbolts to gaia sets out to find the source of the music he hears 83 finding cadmus he challenges him to a contest offering cadmus any goddess as wife excepting hera whom typhon has reserved for himself 84 cadmus then tells typhon that if he liked the little tune of his pipes then he would love the music of his lyre  if only it could be strung with zeus sinews 85 so typhon retrieves the sinews and gives them to cadmus who hides them in another cave and again begins to play his bewitching pipes so that typhoeus yielded his whole soul to cadmos for the melody to charm 86 with typhon distracted zeus takes back his thunderbolts cadmus stops playing and typhon released from his spell rushes back to his cave to discover the thunderbolts gone incensed typhon unleashes devastation upon the world animals are devoured typhon's many animal heads each eat animals of its own kind rivers turned to dust seas made dry land and the land laid waste 87 the day ends with typhon yet unchallenged and while the other gods moved about the cloudless nile zeus waits through the night for the coming dawn 88 victory reproaches zeus urging him to stand up as champion of your own children! [89 dawn comes and typhon roars out a challenge to zeus 90 and a cataclysmic battle for the sceptre and throne of zeus is joined typhon piles up mountains as battlements and with his legions of arms innumerable showers volley after volley of trees and rocks at zeus but all are destroyed or blown aside or dodged or thrown back at typhon typhon throws torrents of water at zeus thunderbolts to quench them but zeus is able to cut off some of typhon's hands with frozen volleys of air as by a knife and hurling thunderbolts is able to burn more of typhon's endless hands and cut off some of his countless heads typhon is attacked by the four winds and frozen volleys of jagged hailstones 91 gaia tries to aid her burnt and frozen son 92 finally typhon falls and zeus shouts out a long stream of mocking taunts telling typhon that he is to be buried under sicily's hills with a cenotaph over him which will read this is the barrow of typhoeus son of earth who once lashed the sky with stones and the fire of heaven burnt him up 93 burial and cause of volcanic activity etna and ischia most accounts have the defeated typhon buried under either mount etna in sicily or the volcanic island of ischia the largest of the phlegraean islands off the coast of naples with typhon being the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes though hesiod has typhon simply cast into tartarus by zeus some have read a reference to mount etna in hesiod's description of typhon's fall and flame shot forth from the thunderstricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount when he was smitten a great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapor and melted as tin melts when heated by men's art in channelled crucibles or as iron which is hardest of all things is shortened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of hephaestus even so then the earth melted in the glow of the blazing fire 94 the first certain references to typhon buried under etna as well as being the cause of its eruptions occur in pindar son of cronus you who hold aetna the wind-swept weight on terrible hundred-headed typhon 95 and among them is he who lies in dread tartarus that enemy of the gods typhon with his hundred heads once the famous cilician cave nurtured him but now the sea-girt cliffs above cumae and sicily too lie heavy on his shaggy chest and the pillar of the sky holds him down snow-covered aetna year-round nurse of bitter frost from whose inmost caves belch forth the purest streams of unapproachable fire in the daytime her rivers roll out a fiery flood of smoke while in the darkness of night the crimson flame hurls rocks down to the deep plain of the sea with a crashing roar that monster shoots up the most terrible jets of fire it is a marvellous wonder to see and a marvel even to hear about when men are present such a creature is bound beneath the dark and leafy heights of aetna and beneath the plain and his bed scratches and goads the whole length of his back stretched out against it 96 thus pindar has typhon in tartarus and buried under not just etna but under a vast volcanic region stretching from sicily to cumae in the vicinity of modern naples a region which presumably also included mount vesuvius as well as ischia 97 many subsequent accounts mention either etna[98 or ischia 99 in prometheus bound typhon is imprisoned underneath etna while above him hephaestus hammers the molten ore and in his rage the charred typhon causes rivers of fire to pour forth ovid has typhon buried under all of sicily with his left and right hands under pelorus and pachynus his feet under lilybaeus and his head under etna where he vomits flames from his ferocious mouth and valerius flaccus has typhon's head under etna and all of sicily shaken when typhon struggles lycophron has both typhon and giants buried under the island of ischia virgil silius italicus and claudian all calling the island inarime have typhon buried there strabo calling ischia pithecussae reports the myth that typhon lay buried there and that when he turns his body the flames and the waters and sometimes even small islands containing boiling water spout forth 100 in addition to typhon other mythological beings were also said to be buried under mount etna and the cause of its volcanic activity most notably the giant enceladus was said to be entombed under etna the volcano's eruptions being the breath of enceladus and its tremors caused by the giant rolling over from side to side beneath the mountain 101 also said to be buried under etna were the hundred-hander briareus 102 and asteropus who was perhaps one of the cyclopes 103 boeotia typhon's final resting place was apparently also said to be in boeotia 104 the hesiodic shield of heracles names a mountain near thebes typhaonium perhaps reflecting an early tradition which also had typhon buried under a boeotian mountain 105 and some apparently claimed that typhon was buried beneath a mountain in boeotia from which came exhaltations of fire 106 couch of typhoeus homer describes a place he calls the couch or bed of typhoeus which he locates in the land of the arimoi   where zeus lashes the land about typhoeus with his thunderbolts 107 presumably this is the same land where according to hesiod typhon's mate echidna keeps guard in arima   108 but neither homer nor hesiod say anything more about where these arimoi or this arima might be the question of whether an historical place was meant and its possible location has been since ancient times the subject of speculation and debate 109 strabo discusses the question in some detail 110 several locales cilicia syria lydia and the island of ischia all places associated with typhon are given by strabo as possible locations for homer's arimoi pindar has his cilician typhon slain by zeus among the arimoi 111 and the historian callisthenes 4th century bc located the arimoi and the arima mountains in cilicia near the calycadnus river the corycian cave and the sarpedon promomtory 112 the b scholia to iliad 2.783 mentioned above says typhon was born in cilicia under arimon 113 and nonnus mentions typhon's bloodstained cave of arima in cilicia 114 just across the gulf of issus from corycus in ancient syria was mount kasios modern jebel aqra and the orontes river sites associated with typhon's battle with zeus 115 and according to strabo the historian posidonius c 2nd century bc identified the arimoi with the aramaeans of syria 116 alternatively according to strabo some placed the arimoi at catacecaumene 117 while xanthus of lydia 5th century bc added that a certain arimus ruled there 118 strabo also tells us that for some homer's couch of typhon was located in a wooded place in the fertile land of hyde with hyde being another name for sardis or its acropolis and that demetrius of scepsis 2nd century bc thought that the arimoi were most plausibly located in the catacecaumene country in mysia 119 the 3rd-century bc poet lycophron placed the lair of typhons mate echidna in this region 120 another place mentioned by strabo as being associated with arima is the island of ischia where according to pherecydes of leros typhon had fled and in the area where pindar and others had said typhon was buried the connection to arima comes from the island's greek name pithecussae which derives from the greek word for monkey and according to strabo residents of the island said that arimoi was also the etruscan word for monkeys 121 name typhon's name has a number of variants 122 the earliest forms of typhoeus and typhaon occur prior to the 5th century bc homer uses typhoeus 123 hesiod and the homeric hymn to apollo use both typhoeus and typhaon 124 the later forms typhos and typhon occur from the 5th century bc onwards with typhon becoming the standard form by the end of that century though several possible derivations of the name typhon have been suggested the derivation remains uncertain 125 consistent with hesiod's making storm winds typhon's offspring some have supposed that typhon was originally a wind-god and ancient sources associated him with the greek words tuphon tuphos meaning whirlwind 126 other theories include derivation from a greek root meaning smoke consistent with typhon's identification with volcanoes 127 from an indo-european root meaning abyss making typhon a serpent of the deep 128 and from sapn the phoenician name for the ugaritic god baal's holy mountain jebel aqra the classical mount kasios associated with the epithet baal sapn 129 comparative mythology succession myth the typhonomachy zeus battle and defeat of typhon is just one part of a larger succession myth given in hesiod's theogony 130 the hesiodic succession myth describes how uranus the original ruler of the cosmos hid his offspring away inside gaia but was overthrown by his titan son cronus who castrated uranus and how in turn cronus who swallowed his children as they were born was himself overthrown by his son zeus whose mother had given cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes to swallow in place of zeus however zeus is then confronted with one final adversary typhon which he quickly defeats now clearly the supreme power in the cosmos zeus is elected king of gods zeus then establishes and secures his realm through the apportionment of various functions and responsibilities to the other gods and by means of marriage finally by swallowing his first wife metis who was destined to produce a son stronger than himself zeus is able to put an end to the cycle of succession python typhon's story seems related to that of another monstrous offspring of gaia python the serpent killed by apollo at delphi 131 suggesting a possible common origin 132 besides the similarity of names their shared parentage and the fact that both were snaky monsters killed in single combat with an olympian god there are other connections between the stories surrounding typhon and those surrounding python 133 although the delphic monster killed by apollo is usually said to be the male serpent python in the homeric hymn to apollo the earliest account of this story the god kills a nameless she-serpent drakaina subsequently called delphyne who had been typhon's foster-mother 134 delphyne and echidna besides both being intimately connected to typhonone as mother the other as mateshare other similarities 135 both were half-maid and half-snake 136 a plague to men 137 and associated with the corycian cave in cilicia 138 python was also perhaps connected with a different corycian cave than the one in cilicia this one on the slopes of parnassus above delphi and just as the corcian cave in cilicia was thought to be typhon and echidna's lair and associated with typhon's battle with zeus there is evidence to suggest that the corycian cave above delphi was supposed to be python's or delphyne's lair and associated with his or her battle with apollo 139 near eastern influence from at least as early as pindar and possibly as early as homer and hesiod with their references to the arimoi and arima typhon's birth place and battle with zeus were associated with various near east locales in cilicia and syria including the corycian cave mount kasios and the orontes river besides this coincidence of place the hesiodic succession myth including the typhonomachy as well as other greek accounts of these myths exhibit other parallels with several ancient near eastern antecedents and it is generally held that the greek accounts are intimately connected with and influenced by these near eastern counterparts 140 in particular the typhonomachy is generally thought to have been influenced by several near eastern monster-slaying myths 141 mesopotamia three related god vs monster combat myths from mesopotamia date from at least the early second-millennium bc or earlier these are the battles of the god ninurta with the monsters asag and anzu and the god marduk's battle with the monstrous tiamat ninurta vs asag lugal-e a late-third-millennium bc sumerian poem tells the story of the battle between the mesopotamian hero-god ninurta and the terrible monster asag 142 like typhon asag was a monstrous hissing offspring of earth ki who grew mighty and challenged the rule of ninurta who like zeus was a storm-god employing winds and floods as weapons as in hesiod's account of the typhonomachy during their battle both asag and ninurta set fire to the landscape and like apollodorus typhon asag evidently won an initial victory before being finally overcome by ninurta ninurta vs anzu ninurta with his thunderbolts battles the winged anzu palace relief nineveh the early second millennium bc akkadian epic anzu tells the story of another combat of ninurta with a monstrous challenger 143 his foe is the winged monster anzu another offspring of earth like hesiod's typhon anzu roared like a lion 144 and was the source of destructive storm winds ninurta destroys anzu on a mountainside and is portrayed as lashing the ground where anzu lay with a rainstorm and floodwaters just as homer has zeus lash the land about typhon with his thundebolts 145 marduk vs tiamat the early second-millenium bc babylonian-akkadian creation epic enma eli tells the story of the battle of the babylonian supreme god marduk with tiamat the sea personified 146 like zeus marduk was a storm-god who employed wind and lightning as weapons and who before he can succeed to the kingship of the gods must defeat a huge and fearsome enemy in single combat 147 this time the monster is female and may be related to the pythian dragoness delphyne 148 or typhon's mate echidna since like echidna tiamat was the mother of a brood of monsters 149 mount kasios like the typhonomachy several near east myths tell of battles between a storm-god and a snaky monster associated with mount kasios the modern jebel aqra these myths are usually considered to be the origins of the myth of zeuss battle with typhon 150 baal sapon vs yam from the south side of the jebel aqra comes the tale of baal sapon and yam the deified sea like tiamat above fragmentary ugaritic tablets dated to the fourteenth or thirteenth-century bc tell the story of the canaanite storm-god baal sapons battle against the monstrous yam on mount sapuna the canaanite name for later greeks mount kasios baal defeats yam with two throwing clubs thunderbolts named expeller and chaser which fly like eagles from the storm-gods hands other tablets associate the defeat of the snaky yam with the slaying of a seven headed serpent ltn litan lotan apparently corresponding to the biblical leviathan 151 tarhunna vs illuyanka tarhunna battles the serpent illuyanka museum of anatolian civilizations ankara turkey from the north side of the jebel aqra come hittite myths c 1250 bc which tell two versions of the storm-god tarhunnas tarhuntas battle against the serpent illuyanka s 152 in both of these versions tarhunna suffers an initial defeat against illuyanka in one version tarhunna seeks help from the goddess inara who lures illuyanka from his lair with a banquet thereby enabling tarhunna to surprise and kill illuyanka in the other version illuyanka steels the heart and eyes of the defeated god but tarhunnas son marries a daughter of illuyanka and is able to retrieve tarhunnas stolen body parts whereupon tarhunna kills illuyanka these stories particularly resemble details found in the accounts of the typhonomachy of apollodorus oppian and nonnus which though late accounts possible preserve much earlier ones 153 the storm-gods initial defeat apollodorus nonnus the loss of vital body parts sinews apollodorus nonnus the help of allies hermes and aegipan apollodorus cadmos and pan nonnus pan oppian the luring of the serpentine opponent from his lair through the trickery of a banquet oppian or by music nonnus teshub vs hedammu and ullikummi another c 1250 bc hittite text derived from the hurrians tells of the hurrian storm-god teshub with whom the hittite's tarhunna came to be identified who lived on mount hazzi the hurrian name for the jebel aqra and his battle with the sea-serpent hedammu again the storm-god is aided by a goddess sauska equivalent to inaru who this time seduces the monster with music as in nonnus drink and sex successfully luring the serpent from his lair in the sea 154 just as the typhonomachy can be seen as a sequel to the titanomachy a different hittite text derived from the hurrians the song of ullikummi a kind of sequel to the hittite kingship in heaven succession myths of which the story of teshub and hedammu formed a part tells of a second monster this time made of stone named ullikummi that teshub must defeat in order to secure his rule 155 set from apparently as early as hecataeus of miletus c 550 bc  c 476 bc typhon was identified with set the egyptian god of destruction 156 this syncretization with egyptian mythology can also be seen in the story apparently known as early as pindar of typhon chasing the gods to egypt and the gods transforming themselves into animals 157 such a story arose perhaps as a way for the greeks to explain egypt's animal-shaped gods 158 herodotus also identified typhon with set making him the second to last divine king of egypt herodotus says that typhon was deposed by osiris son horus whom herodutus equates with apollo with osiris being equated with dionysus 159 and after his defeat by horus typhon was supposed to have been hidden in the serbonian marsh identified with modern lake bardawil in egypt 160 confused with the giants typhon bears a close resemblance to an older generation of descendants of gaia the giants 161 they like their younger brother typhon after them challenged zeus for supremacy of the cosmos 162 were in later representations shown as snake-footed 163 and end up buried under volcanos 164 while distinct in early accounts in later accounts typhon was often considered to be one of the giants 165 the roman mythographer hyginus 64 bc  17 ad includes typhon in his list of giants 166 while the roman poet horace 65  8 bc mentions typhon along with the giants mimas porphyrion and enceladus as together battling athena during the gigantomachy 167 the astronomica attributed to the 1st-century ad roman poet and astrologer marcus manilius 168 and the late 4th-century early 5th-century greek poet nonnus also consider typhon to be one of the giants 169 notes references aeschylus seven against thebes in aeschylus with an english
