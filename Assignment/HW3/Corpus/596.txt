rated the album four stars and suggested that the band offer[s up another collection of sweeping reverent rock songs on which he alluded to how the album flirts with touches of roots rock and traditional gospel though from the title track's powerful southern stomp to the sheer power of bear rinehart's voice 1 furthermore leahey noted the album covers more ground than records by similar artists and it does so without alienating any of its secular-minded listeners too 1 matt conner of ccm magazine indicated in a positive review that the album brings even more evidence to the table that rinehart's rock sensibilities only improve with time and conner also mentioned that the album's second half provides some of the most beautiful moments on the record 17 at christian music review
