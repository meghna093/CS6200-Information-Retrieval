texas northern mexico part of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season hurricane claudette was the third tropical storm and first hurricane of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season a fairly long-lived july atlantic hurricane claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern caribbean it moved quickly westward brushing past the yucatn peninsula before moving northwestward through the gulf of mexico claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in port o'connor texas when it quickly strengthened to a strong category 1 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path claudette was the first hurricane to make landfall in july in the united states since hurricane danny in the 1997 season the hurricane caused one death and moderate damage in texas mostly from strong winds as well as extensive beach erosion because of the damage president george w bush declared portions of south texas a federal disaster area allowing the affected citizens to apply for aid claudette also caused significant rainfall and minor damage in the mexican state of quintana roo as a tropical storm as well as minor damage on saint lucia before developing into a tropical cyclone meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on july 1 it steadily organized as it moved westward and resembled a tropical depression by july 7 however surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics and remained simply a low-pressure system the wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it moved through the lesser antilles on july 8 but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern caribbean because it had tropical storm-force winds the system was upgraded immediately to tropical storm claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on july 8.[1 by early on july 9 while south of puerto rico claudette quickly strengthened over the warm waters of the caribbean and its strongest winds were just shy of the threshold for hurricane intensity possibly due to its fast forward motion the storm became disorganized and weakened conditions briefly became more favorable over the western caribbean and claudette reached hurricane status for six hours on july 10 soon after the storm encountered unfavorable upper-level winds and weakened back into a tropical storm in response to a break in the subtropical ridgea high-pressure ridge that often prevents tropical systems from moving northwardit turned to the west-northwest claudette made its first landfall at puerto morelos on the yucatn peninsula on july 11 as a tropical storm with 60 mph 97 km h winds 1 claudette wobbled to the northwest over the gulf of mexico and gradually restrengthened upper-level winds steadily decreased and claudette again became a hurricane late on july 14 just prior to landfall it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction striking port o'connor texas on july 15 as a category 1 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with 90 mph 150 km h winds residents along and inland of the central texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival the hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of july 15 but instead came ashore before noon 2 furthermore some initial estimates suggested that claudette had reached category 2 status with sustained winds of up to 100 mph 155 km h these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data 1 as slow as claudette was to strengthen it was also slow to dissipate over land inland hurricane warnings were issued for several counties away from the coastline and winds gusted to 83 mph 134 km h at victoria regional airport 2 it maintained tropical storm intensity for over 24 hours after landfall a rarity for such a weak storm most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall as they are separated from the warm waters that power them the storm finally lost its low-level circulation early on july 17 over chihuahua although its rainfall and upper-level circulation continued into the pacific ocean 1 preparations mexican officials issued a tropical storm warning 37 hours prior to the storm's landfall between chetumal and cabo catoche quintana roo the warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning about a day before landfall but was downgraded when claudette weakened just 13 hours prior to its landfall in the yucatn peninsula 1 the mexican government declared a state of emergency in the projected path of the storm and declared an evacuation order for 1,500 citizens in quintana roo there residents remained calm during the evacuation 3 tourists left nightclubs for supermarkets to stock up on among other items beer which was banned at midnight schools were set up as shelters while police forced tourists to remain in their hotels 4 the consistent variation in the path of claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall on july 13 two days prior to claudette's eventual landfall the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch between brownsville and port o'connor texas by the next day a hurricane warning existed from baffin bay to high island texas while a tropical storm warning extended from high island to intracoastal city louisiana when it became apparent that louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm the state's tropical storm warnings were canceled 1 in texas galveston county officials recommended evacuations for western galveston island and jamaica beach 24 hours prior to claudette's projected landfall the emergency phone notification system notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion some of whom remembered the flooding from tropical storm frances five years before 5 hurricane claudette also affected the oil industry exxonmobil chevron conocophillips shell oil marathon oil unocal corporation and anadarko petroleum corporation all limited production and evacuated many of their workers chevron which evacuated more than 1,800 workers returned many of its workers on the day when claudette made landfall unocal closed 23 rigs and platforms in the region the combined closures stopped the daily production of 225,000 barrels 35,800 m3 per day of oil and 2 billion cubic feet 57,000,000 m3 of natural gas which accounted for 15 of the total production in the gulf of mexico 6 impact

fishermen moved their boats from the water to safety while a cruise line diverted three ships away from claudette's path 11 in the cayman islands where the storm remained 165 miles 266 km away at its closest point rainfall totals ranged from 1 to 3 inches 25 to 76 mm 1 on the south side of grand cayman claudette caused wave heights of around 10 feet 3.0 m while the western side received little

reported a storm tide the overall rise of water over the mean low tideof 9.15 feet 2.79 m claudette produced moderate rainfall across southern texas peaking at 6.5 inches 170 mm in tilden on matagorda island the local weather station measured winds of 75 mph 121 km h the only official report of hurricane-force winds along the coastline however several offshore oil rigs reported winds of up to 90 mph 140 km h and one unofficial reading in seadrift indicated winds of 96.6 mph 155.5 km h this report would suggest the storm was a low-end category 2 hurricane though this contradicted hurricane hunters data which pointed to a storm of a lesser intensity 1 severe beach erosion occurred from high island to freeport though large geo-tubes reduced the erosion on galveston island and the bolivar peninsula 14 the outer bands of the hurricane spawned two tornadoes one was an f1 on the fujita scale that caused damage to several buildings in palacios and the other damaged homes in port lavaca 1 widespread flooding and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast texas coastline most of which occurred in matagorda county in addition the winds damaged 1,407 homes with 144 of them being
