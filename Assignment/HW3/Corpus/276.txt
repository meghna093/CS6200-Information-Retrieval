aai aerosonde  wikipediafor the australian manufacturer of uavs see aerosonde ltd aerosonde aerosonde laima in display at museum of flight seattle wa role unmanned aerial vehicle national origin australia manufacturer aerosonde ltd a division of textron the aai aerosonde is a small unmanned aerial vehicle uav designed to collect weather data including temperature atmospheric pressure humidity and wind measurements over oceans and remote areas the aerosonde was developed by insitu and is now manufactured by aerosonde ltd which is a strategic business of aai corporation the aerosonde is powered by a modified enya r120 model aircraft engine and carries on board a small computer meteorological instruments and a gps receiver for navigation it is also used by the united states armed forces for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr design and development on august 21 1998 a phase 1 aerosonde nicknamed laima after the ancient latvian deity of good fortune completed a 2,031 mile 3,270 km flight across the atlantic ocean this was the first crossing of the atlantic ocean by a uav at the time it was also the smallest aircraft ever to cross the atlantic[1 the smallest aircraft record was subsequently broken by the spirit of butts farm uav launched from a roof rack of a moving car due to its lack of undercarriage laima flew from newfoundland canada to benbecula an island off the coast of scotland in 26 hours 45 minutes in stormy weather using approximately 1.5 u s gallons 1.25 imperial gallons or 5.7 litres of gasoline petrol other than for take-off and landing the flight was autonomous without external control at an altitude of 5,500 ft 1,680 meters aerosondes have also been the first unmanned aircraft to penetrate tropical cyclones with an initial mission in 2001[2 followed by eye penetrations in 2005.[3 operational history on 5 march 2012 the u s special operations command socom awarded aai a contract to provide the aerosonde-g for their mid-endurance uas ii program the catapult-launched air vehicle has a takeoff weight 39 or 55 lb 18 or 25 kg depending on engine type with endurance of over 10 hours and an electro-optic infrared and laser-pointer payload 4 the aerosonde has been employed by socom and u s naval air systems command navair under the designation mq-19 under service provision contracts a typical system comprises four air vehicles and two ground control stations that are accommodated in tents or tailored to fit in most vehicles the system can also include remote video terminals for individual users to uplink new navigation waypoints and sensor commands to and receive sensor imagery and video from the vehicle from a ruggedized tablet device originally the aerosonde suffered from engine-reliability issues but textron says it has rectified those issues 5 by november 2015 textron systems was performing aerosonde operations in eight or nine countries for its users including the u s marine corps u s air force and socom as well as for commercial users consisting of a customer in the oil and gas industry instead of buying hardware customers pay for sensor hours  and the company decides how many aircraft are produced to meet requirements 4,000 fee-for-service hours were being performed monthly and the aerosonde had exceeded 110,000 flight hours in service 6 variants this section is empty you can help by adding to it
