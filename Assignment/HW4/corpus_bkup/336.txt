maize tomato and beans which produced an agricultural surplus this enabled the transition from paleo-indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 bce 43 in the subsequent formative eras maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex and a vigesimal numeric system were diffused from the mexican cultures to the rest of the

the publication of the work of william h prescott it was adopted by most of the world including 19th-century mexican scholars who considered it a way to distinguish present-day mexicans from pre-conquest mexicans this usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century 49 the aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them it was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected for example the southern peripheral zones of xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center the hegemonic nature of the aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was
