of pressure is from the gradient of density in a fluid 1]  [6 the term baroclinic refers to the mechanism by which vorticity is generated vorticity is the curl of the velocity field in general the evolution of vorticity can be broken into contributions from advection as vortex tubes move with the flow stretching and twisting as vortex tubes are pulled or twisted by the flow and baroclinic vorticity generation which occurs whenever there is a density gradient along surfaces of constant pressure baroclinic flows can be contrasted with barotropic flows in which density and pressure surfaces coincide and there is no baroclinic generation of vorticity the study of the evolution of these baroclinic instabilities as they grow and then decay is a crucial part of developing theories for the fundamental characteristics of midlatitude weather baroclinic vector beginning with the equation of motion for a frictionless fluid the euler equations and taking the curl one arrives at the equation of motion for the curl of the fluid velocity that is to say the vorticity in a fluid that is not all of the same density a source term appears in the vorticity equation whenever surfaces of constant density isopycnic surfaces and surfaces of constant pressure isobaric surfaces are not aligned the material derivative of the local vorticity is given by where is the velocity and is the vorticity is pressure and is density the baroclinic contribution is the vector this vector is of interest both in compressible fluids and in incompressible but inhomogeneous fluids internal gravity waves as well as unstable rayleightaylor modes can be analyzed from the perspective of the baroclinic vector it is also of interest in the creation of vorticity by the passage of shocks through inhomogeneous media such as in the richtmyermeshkov instability divers may be familiar with the very slow waves that can be excited at a thermocline or a halocline these are internal waves similar waves can be generated between a layer of water and a layer of oil when the interface between these two surfaces is not horizontal and the system is close to hydrostatic equilibrium the gradient of the pressure is vertical but the gradient of the density is not therefore the baroclinic vector is nonzero and the sense of the baroclinic vector is to create vorticity to make the interface level out in the process the interface overshoots and the result is an oscillation which is an internal gravity wave unlike surface gravity waves internal gravity waves do not require a sharp interface for example in bodies of water a gradual gradient in temperature or salinity is sufficient to support internal gravity waves driven by the baroclinic vector notes  marshall j and r a plumb 2007 atmosphere
