pollution is particularly intense point sources and mapped them as areas of concern a remedial action plan has been developed for each area some lake ontario areas of concern include the oswego river and rochester embayment on the american side and hamilton harbour and toronto on the canadian side citation needed by the 1960s and 1970s the increased pollution caused frequent algal blooms to occur in the summer 8 these blooms killed large numbers of fish and left decomposing piles of filamentous algae and dead fish along the shores 31 at times the blooms became so thick that waves could not break fish eating birds such as osprey bald eagle and cormorant were being poisoned by contaminated fish since the 1960s and 1970s environmental concerns have forced a cleanup of industrial and municipal wastes cleanup has been accomplished through better treatment plants tighter environmental regulations deindustrialization and increased public awareness today lake ontario has recovered some of its pristine quality for example walleye a fish species considered as a marker of clean water are now found however regional airshed pollution remains a concern the lake has also become an important sport fishery although with introduced species coho and chinook salmon rather than the native species bald eagle and osprey populations are also beginning to recover invasive species are a problem for lake ontario particularly lamprey and zebra mussels lamprey are being controlled by poisoning in the juvenile stage in the streams where they breed zebra mussels in particular are difficult to control and pose major challenges for the lake and its waterways climate the lake has a natural seiche rhythm of eleven minutes the seiche effect normally is only about 34 inches 2 cm but can be greatly amplified by earth movement winds and atmospheric pressure changes because of its great depth the lake as a whole never freezes in winter but an ice sheet covering between 10 and 90 of the lake area typically develops depending on the severity of the winter ice sheets typically form along the shoreline and in slack water bays where the lake is not as deep during the winters of 1877 and 1878 the ice sheet coverage was up to 95100 in most of the lake in the winter of 1812 the ice cover was stable enough that the american naval commander stationed at sackets harbor feared a british attack from kingston over the ice when the cold winds of winter pass over the warmer water of the lake they pick up moisture and drop it as lake-effect snow since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake is referred to as the snowbelt in some winters the area between oswego and pulaski may receive twenty or more feet 600 cm of snowfall also impacted by lake-effect snow is the tug hill plateau an area of elevated land that is about 20 miles 32 km east of lake ontario creating ideal conditions for lake-effect snowfall the hill as it is often referred to typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern united states as a result tug hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as syracuse with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the united states other cities in the world receive more snow annually such as quebec city which averages 135 inches 340 cm and sapporo japan which receives 250 inches 640 cm each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world foggy conditions particularly in fall can be created by thermal contrasts and can be an impediment for recreational boaters in a normal winter lake ontario will be at most one quarter ice-covered in a mild winter almost completely unfrozen lake ontario has completely frozen over on five recorded occasions from about january 20 to about march 20 1830;  [37 swims across the lake as of 2012[update nearly 50 people have successfully swum across the lake 38 the first person who accomplished the feat was marilyn bell who did it in 1954 at the age of 16 toronto's marilyn bell park is named in her honour the park opened in 1984 and is located just to the east of the spot where bell completed her swim 39 in 1974 diana nyad became the first person who swam across the lake against the current from north to south 40 on august 28 2007 14-year-old natalie lambert from kingston ontario made the swim leaving sackets harbor new york and reaching kingston's confederation basin less than 24 hours after she entered the lake 41 on august 19 2012 14-year-old annaleise carr became the youngest person to swim across the lake she completed the 32-mile 52-km crossing from niagara-on-the-lake to marilyn bell park in just under 27 hours 42 industrialisation the government of ontario which holds the lakebed rights of the canadian portion of the lake under the beds of navigable waters act 43
