tropical cyclone forecast model  wikipedia a tropical cyclone forecast model is a computer program that uses meteorological data to forecast aspects of the future state of tropical cyclones there are three types of models statistical dynamical or combined statistical-dynamic 1 dynamical models utilize powerful supercomputers with sophisticated mathematical modeling software and meteorological data to calculate future weather conditions statistical models forecast the evolution of a tropical cyclone in a simpler manner by extrapolating from historical datasets and thus can be run quickly on platforms such as personal computers statistical-dynamical models use aspects of both types of forecasting four primary types of forecasts exist for tropical cyclones track intensity storm surge and rainfall dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem track models did not show forecast skill when compared to statistical models until the 1980s statistical-dynamical models were used from the 1970s into the 1990s early models use data from previous model runs while late models produce output after the official hurricane forecast has been sent the use of consensus ensemble and superensemble forecasts lowers errors more than any individual forecast model both consensus and superensemble forecasts can use the guidance of global and regional models runs to improve the performance more than any of their respective components techniques used at the joint typhoon warning center indicate that superensemble forecasts are a very powerful tool for track forecasting statistical guidance r-cliper for hurricane isabel 2003 the first statistical guidance used by the national hurricane center was the hurricane analog technique hurran which was available in 1969 it used the newly developed north atlantic tropical cyclone database to find storms with similar tracks it then shifted their tracks through the storm's current path and used location direction and speed of motion and the date to find suitable analogs the method did well with storms south of the 25th parallel which had not yet turned northward but poorly with systems near or after recurvature 2 since 1972 the climatology and persistence cliper statistical model has been used to help generate tropical cyclone track forecasts in the era of skillful dynamical forecasts cliper is now being used as the baseline to show model and forecaster skill 3 the statistical hurricane intensity forecast shifor has been used since 1979 for tropical cyclone intensity forecasting it uses climatology and persistence to predict future intensity including the current julian day current cyclone intensity the cyclone's intensity 12 hours ago the storm's initial latitude and longitude as well as its zonal east-west and meridional north-south components of motion 2 a series of statistical-dynamical models which used regression equations based upon cliper output and the latest output from primitive equation models run at the national meteorological center then national centers for environmental prediction were developed between the 1970s and 1990s and were named nhc73 nhc83 nhc90 nhc91 and nhc98.   [28 the jma has produced an 11-member ensemble forecast system for typhoons known as the typhoon ensemble prediction system teps since february 2008 which is run out to 132 hours into the future it uses a lower resolution version with larger grid spacing of its gsm with ten perturbed members and one non-perturbed member the system reduces errors by an average of 40 kilometres 25 mi five days into the future when compared to its higher resolution gsm 29 the florida state super ensemble fsse is produced from a suite of models which then uses statistical regression equations developed over a training phase to reduce their biases which produces forecasts better than the member models or their mean solution it uses 11 global models including five developed at florida state university the unified model the gfs the nogaps the united states navy nogaps the australian bureau of meteorology research centre bmrc model and canadian recherche en prvision numrique rpn model it shows significant skill in track intensity and rainfall predictions of tropical cyclones 30 the systematic approach forecast aid safa was developed by the joint typhoon warning center to create a selective consensus forecast which removed more erroneous forecasts at a 72hour time frame from consideration using the united states navy nogaps model the gfdl the japan meteorological agency's global and typhoon models as well as the ukmet all the models improved during safa's five-year history and removing erroneous forecasts proved difficult to do in operations 31 sunspot theory a 2010 report correlates low sunspot activity with high hurricane activity analyzing historical data there was a 25 chance of at least one hurricane striking the continental united states during a peak sunspot year a 64 chance during a low sunspot year in june 2010 the hurricanes predictors in the us were not using this information 32 hurricane forecast model accuracy the accuracy of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm for some storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are relatively straightforward and the models are not only accurate but they produce similar forecasts while for other storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are more complex and different models produce very different forecasts 33 see also tropical cyclones portal tropical cyclone forecasting tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting weather forecasting references external links tropical cyclone forecasters reference guide chapter 5 model analyses and forecasts from ncep national hurricane center forecast model background and information v t e atmospheric oceanographic and climate models model types atmospheric model climate model numerical weather prediction tropical cyclone forecast model atmospheric dispersion modeling chemical transport model upper-atmospheric models ensemble forecasting model output statistics meteorological reanalysis parametrization specific models climate igcm hadcm3 hadgem1 gfdl cm2.x cgcm ccsm cesm cfsv2 echam mpas global weather ifs ecmwf fim gem  gdps gfs naefs navgem um jma-gsm gme  icon arpege regional and mesoscale atmospheric nam rr  rap rams wrf raqms hirlam laps rpm regional and mesoscale oceanographic hycom roms pom mom fvcom mitgcm fesom atmospheric dispersion adms aermod atstep austal2000 calpuff dispersion21 isc3 memo mercure name ospm puff-plume rimpuff safe air chemical transport clams mozart geos-chem land surface parametrization jules class isba discontinued avn  mrf  gsm eta lfm mm5 ngm nogaps ruc mathematical model statistical model scientific modelling computer simulation
