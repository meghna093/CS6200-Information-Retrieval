list of the most intense tropical cyclones  wikipedia tropical cyclone intensity is a complex topic winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds however variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult in addition other impacts like rainfall storm surge area of wind damages and tornadoes can be significant variations in storms with similar wind speeds pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because measurements is easier to measure and consistent tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on earth however although there is strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds as each storm's relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different 1 in the most recent and reliable records most tropical cyclones which attained a pressure of 900 hpa mbar 26.56 inhg or less occurred in the western north pacific ocean the strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide as measured by minimum central pressure was typhoon tip which reached a pressure of 870 hpa 25.69 inhg on october 12 1979.[2 the following list is subdivided by basins data listed are provided by the official regional specialized meteorological centre unless otherwise noted on october 23 2015 hurricane patricia attained the strongest 1-minute sustained winds on record at 215 mph 345 km h 3 north atlantic ocean hurricane allen at peak intensity hurricane gilbert at peak intensity hurricane wilma near record strength the most intense storm in the north atlantic by lowest pressure was hurricane wilma the strongest storm by 1-minute sustained winds was hurricane allen storms which reached a minimum central pressure of 920 hectopascals 27.17 inhg or less are listed storm information has been compiled back to 1850 though measurements were rarer until aircraft reconnaissance started in the 1940s and inexact estimates were still predominant until dropsondes were implemented in the 1970s 4 eastern pacific ocean hurricane patricia shortly after peak intensity the most intense storm in the eastern pacific ocean by both sustained winds and central pressure was hurricane patricia its sustained winds of 345 km h 215 mph are also the highest on record globally storms with a minimum central pressure of 925 hpa 27.32 inhg or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1949 and most storms since are only estimated because landfall and related reconnaissance are less common in this basin 6 cyclone season peak 1-min sustained winds
