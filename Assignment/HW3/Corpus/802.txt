[31 damage was limited to the portions of the coast which was impacted by minor storm surge peaking at 3.9 ft 1.2 m above mean sea level at freeport some piers and arterial beach roads adjacent to the coast were damaged portions of texas state highway 87 on the bolivar peninsula were inundated by floodwater minor property damage occurred and no persons were injured in texas 19 tracking across the southern areas of mississippi 32 hilda and later its remnants brought torrential rainfall to central and southern portions of the state 25 the mccomb-pike county airport received 12.57 in 319 mm of rain the highest precipitation total statewide 28 the heavy rains resulted in record rainfall totals for the month of october in several locations and flash floods however the majority of damage in the state was a result of strong northerly winds which caused power outages and was destructive to the state's pecan and corn crops which had been nearing harvest cotton crops that were harvested prior to the passage of hilda were largely damaged power outages knocked out 460 telephone circuits and over 30,000 individual telephones strong winds also uprooted and felled trees and their limbs in addition to as well as a 200 ft 61 m tall radio mast near moss point mississippi as a result of hilda 20 people were injured and damage exceeded 50,000 three of those injuries were a result of a tornado which impacted areas of pearl river county destroying a home two barns and a pumping station 25 across mississippi over 14,000 homes were damaged of which 3,000 were either heavily damaged or completely destroyed 32 interacting with a cold front as it traversed alabama the remnants of hilda caused gusts as strong as 80 mph 130 km h in mobile and baldwin counties downing telecommunication lines uprooting trees and shattering windows piers lining mobile bay were either destroyed or damaged five people were injured in those two counties strong winds in russell and lee counties damaged or destroyed several buildings injuring four in addition to straight-line winds three tornadoes occurred across six counties in alabama with one injuring three people after damaging five homes a hospital and a plant 25 although rainfall peaked well inland at 8.91 in 226 mm 28 damage as a result of rain was limited to the coast where the combination of high tides and rain resulted in minor coastal inundation as the remnants of hilda moved across the florida panhandle on october 45 rough surf was produced with high tides causing minor tidal inundation along the florida coast 25 one person drowned in the high surf produced by the storm off of pensacola florida on october 4 squalls in western and northern florida produced heavy rain 25 with a maximum occurring in wewahitchka which received 12.42 in 315 mm 33 the precipitation produced localized flooding in the tallahassee area the squalls also produced strong winds at times gusting to 60 mph 97 km h near pensacola a station at naval air station pensacola clocked a 59 mph 95 km h gust these winds caused minor damage limited to uprooted trees and broken limbs 25 united states east coast rainfall from the remnants of hilda extended as far northeast as delaware as a result of the remnants interacting with a frontal boundary that extended across the united states east coast 27 extremely torrential rains fell over georgia 25 peaking at 12.73 in 323 mm south of waynesboro 29 the largest precipitation totals occurred in the state's northeastern extremities where widespread totals of 8 in 200 mm or higher were reported 34 the rains resulted in flash flooding causing extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure across georgia 35 the excess floodwater caused streams to overflow their banks at least 30 bridges were washed away by these swollen streams and several county roads were washed out 25 the most considerable damage was reported in northeastern georgia coincident with the high rainfall totals there damage in rabun county alone exceeded us 100,000.[35 in addition to infrastructure damage thousands of acres of farmland were inundated 25 torrential rainfall continued northeastwards into the carolinas with statewide rainfall peaking at 11.66 in 296 mm and 12.02 in 305 mm in north and south carolina respectively 29 the rains in north carolina exacerbated preexisting flood conditions which had previously caused widespread agricultural and infrastructural damage as well as soil erosion 25 though not directly a result of hilda's remnants they were likely influenced by the storm's interaction with a frontal boundary already overflowing rivers and streams rose even further reaching near-record levels raleigh experienced severe flooding and roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes due to dangerous floodwaters 36 two cars in mountainous regions were swept into inundated areas during the floods resulting in one death 37 several tornadoes in six counties were also reported injuring two 25 extensive wind damage was reported in wayne county 37 heavy rains in south carolina from october 46 resulted in localized flash flooding particularly near streams 36 in mountainous regions runoff from precipitation caused the keowee saluda and tributaries of the broad river to swell inundated and causing substantial damage to adjacent agricultural land and roads in addition to breaching several small dams the flooding triggered landslides killing one person counties in the coastal plains of south carolina also experienced farmland road and residential damage due to the heavy rains 25 retirement see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names after the season the name hilda was retired making it the fourteenth atlantic tropical cyclone to have its name retired and
