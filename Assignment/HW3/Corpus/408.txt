history of atlantic hurricane warnings  wikipedia the history of atlantic tropical cyclone warnings details the progress of tropical cyclone warnings in the north atlantic ocean the first service was set up in the 1870s from cuba with the work of father benito vies after his death hurricane warning services were assumed by the united states signal corp and united states weather bureau over the next few decades first based in jamaica and cuba before shifting to washington d c the central office in washington which would evolve into the national meteorological center and the weather prediction center assumed the responsibilities by the early 20th century this responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935 and the concept of the atlantic hurricane season was established in order to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time the national hurricane center became a tropical cyclone warning center in 1956 and assumed many of the functions it has today by 1965 the national hurricane research project begun in the 1950s used aircraft to study tropical cyclones and carry out experiments on mature hurricanes through its stormfury project forecasts within the hurricane advisories were issued one day into the future in 1954 before being extended to two days into the future in 1961 three years into the future in 1964 and 31 years into the future in 2001 from the 1960s through the 1980s work from the various regional hurricane offices was consolidated into the national hurricane center its name was changed to the tropical prediction center in 1995 before reassuming its national hurricane center name in 2010 tropical cyclone forecasting is done nowadays using statistical methods based on tropical cyclone climatology as well as methods of numerical weather prediction where computers use mathematical equations of motion to determine their movement early years weather bureau surface weather map of the 1935 labor day hurricane moving up the west coast of florida the first hurricane warning service was set up in the early 1870s from cuba with the work of father benito vies who served as director of the meteorological observatory of the royal college of beln he established a network of observation sites and developed the first method to forecast tropical cyclone movement with the oldest known forecast made for a hurricane in late august 1873. [19 this was when hurricane reconnaissance planes were sent out to fly across the atlantic and gulf of mexico on a routine basis to look for potential tropical cyclones in the years prior to the continuous weather satellite era 17 after regular satellite surveillance began hurricane hunter aircraft flew only into areas which were spotted first by satellite imagery 20 starting in 1958 a cooperative hurricane reporting network composed of over 100 unpaid observers would send observations in real-time during the hurricane season to their local weather bureau offices the spacing of the network was roughly 40 kilometres 25 mi between sites and the locations would report wind speed wind direction rainfall and pressure 21 national hurricane research project nhrp opening day main article national hurricane research project the national hurricane research project nhrp was initiated in 1955 by the united states weather bureau in response to the devastating 1954 hurricane season which significantly impacted the mid-atlantic states and new england robert simpson a weather bureau meteorologist who had participated in air force hurricane reconnaissance flights as an observer was appointed as the first director of nhrp and organized the research operations base at morrison air force base now palm beach international airport in west palm beach florida in 1956 during the first three years of the project scientists used three specially instrumented air force hurricane hunters aircraft with crews on bailment from the 55th weather reconnaissance squadron collecting data which delineated the structure and energy budget of hurricanes for the first time 22 in 1959 the project was moved to miami and collocated with the miami hurricane forecast office the department of commerce leased two dc-6 aircraft and received a b-57 jet from the air force so that nhrp could continue to carry out airborne experiments on hurricanes the combination of research project forecast center and aircraft facility was dubbed the national hurricane center nhc during the 1960s while nhrp continued to carry out research flights the project also began to create computer models of hurricane circulation formulated a statistical track program nhc-64 wrote a manual on hurricane forecasting and evaluated the accuracy of track forecasts 22 starting with hurricane esther 1961 nhrp was heavily involved with project stormfury the u s government's experiment in hurricane modification late in 1964 the project was renamed the national hurricane research laboratory in recognition of it becoming a permanent institution within the weather bureau this presaged the creation of the environmental research laboratories the next year 23 national hurricane center front view of the national hurricane center main article national hurricane center on july 1 1956 a national hurricane information center had become established in miami florida which became a warehouse for all hurricane-related information from one office 24 the miami hurricane warning office hwo was moved from lindsey hopkins hotel to the aviation building 4 miles 6.4 km to the northwest on july 1 1958.[25 forecasts for tropical cyclone movement were extended to two days in advance at one day intervals in 1961.[12 the miami hwo moved to the campus of the university of miami in 1964,[23 which is when tropical cyclone forecasts were extended to three days into the future at one day intervals 12 the miami hwo tropical cyclone reports were done regularly and took on their modern format in 1964.[26 in 1970 nhc began analyzing tropical cyclone initial positions in real-time and added a 12hour forecast 12 beginning in 1973 a portion of the national meteorological center later renamed the weather prediction center [27 gained advisory responsibility for dissipating inland tropical depressions the world meteorological organization assumed control of the atlantic hurricane naming list in 1977.[28 in 1978 the nhc's offices moved off campus to the ire financial building 29 the hurricane warning offices remained active past 1983.[6 organizationally the nhc left the aegis of the national weather service state forecast office in miami in 1984,[30 leaving the southern region and becoming its own national center one of three in existence at that time 1 in 1988 nhc added a 36-hour point to their forecast 12 during the national weather service reorganization in the 1990s the nhc was renamed the tropical prediction center on october 1 1995,[31 and moved into a building on the campus of florida international university 32 the hurricane specialists were grouped as a separate nhc unit under the tropical prediction center 31 separating themselves from the tropical analysis and forecast branch by 2001 tropical cyclone forecasts were extended from three to five days in advance including forecast points for 96 and 120 hours 12 on october 1 2010 the tropical prediction center was renamed the nhc 33 and the group formerly known as the nhc became known as the hurricane specialists unit hsu 34 tropical cyclone forecasting significant track errors still occur on occasion as seen in this ernesto 2006 early forecast the nhc official forecast is light blue while the storm's actual track is the white line over florida see also numerical weather prediction and tropical cyclone forecast model tropical cyclone forecasting relies on data provided by numerical weather models three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that is not based on the physics of the atmosphere at the time dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models 35 in 1978 the first hurricane-tracking model based on atmospheric dynamicsthe movable fine-mesh mfm modelbegan operating 36 within the field of tropical cyclone track forecasting despite the ever-improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power it was not until the 1980s when numerical weather prediction showed skill and until the 1990s when it consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models 37 predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge since statistical methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance 38 advisory watch and warning evolution tropical storm warning flag used in the united states see also tropical cyclone warnings and watches  north atlantic systems the timing and naming of tropical cyclone advisories watches and warnings has changed over time in 1958 tropical cyclone advisories were issued every six hours starting at 0400 utc each day during 1967 hurricane watches were used to designate areas where hurricane conditions were possible in the next 24 hours while hurricane warnings indicated areas where the hurricane center should cross the coast small craft gale and storm warnings were issued for hurricanes not expected to make landfall 39 by 1987 the definition of tropical cyclone watches had changed to areas where gale or hurricane-force winds were possible within 36 hours with warnings issued when gale or hurricane-force winds were expected within 24 hours in 1987 gale watches warnings were renamed tropical storm watches warnings 40 in 1991 advisory timing shifted back to every six hours starting at 0330 utc every day 41 in 1992 advisory timing changed to every six hours starting at 0300 utc each day 42 the length of time used for watches and warnings changed again in 2010 with watches using a 48hour time frame and warnings using a 36-hour time frame 43 within the united states a separate set of inland tropical cyclone warnings was issued by national weather service forecast offices based upon the latest nhc advisory during the decade of the 2000s these warnings used the word wind inserted before the watch or warning which was dropped for 2005 previously standard high wind warnings and watches were issued which denote 39 mph winds or 58 mph gusts when they were inland watches and warnings were posted for tropical storm or hurricane-force winds expected during the next 24 and 12 hours respectively 44 current operations see also national hurricane center and weather prediction center during the hurricane season the national hurricane center routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season special tropical weather outlooks will be issued 45 while a tropical cyclone is active six hourly advisories will be issued which become more frequent once a tropical cyclone watch or warning are issued tropical cyclone watches and warnings are coordinated within the countries and dependencies involved with the national hurricane center coordinating with national weather service forecast offices concerning storms threatening the united states and its dependencies routine coordination occurs at 1700 utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future 46 references
