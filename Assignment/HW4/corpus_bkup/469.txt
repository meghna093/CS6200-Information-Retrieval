[10 code assignment issn codes are assigned by a network of issn national centres usually located at national libraries and coordinated by the issn international centre based in paris the international centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between unesco and the french government the international centre maintains a database of all issns assigned worldwide the isds register international serials data system otherwise known as the issn register at the end of 2016[update the issn register contained records for 1,943,572 items 11 comparison with other identifiers issn and isbn codes are similar in concept where isbns are assigned to individual books an isbn might be assigned for particular issues of a serial in addition to the issn code for the serial as a whole an issn unlike the isbn code is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title containing no information as to the publisher or its location for this reason a new issn is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change since the issn applies to an entire serial a new identifier the serial item and contribution identifier sici was built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes articles or other identifiable components like the table of contents media vs content separate issns are needed for serials in different media except reproduction microforms thus the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate issns 12 also a cd-rom version and a web version of a serial require different issns since two different media are involved however the same issn can be used for different file formats e g pdf and html of the same online serial this media-oriented identification of serials made sense in the 1970s in the 1990s and onward with personal computers better screens and the web it makes sense to consider only content independent of media this content-oriented identification of serials was a repressed demand during a decade but no issn update or initiative occurred a natural extension for issn the unique-identification of the articles in the serials was the main demand application an alternative serials contents model arrived with the indecs content model and its application the digital object identifier doi as issn-independent initiative consolidated in the 2000s only later in 2007 issn-l was defined in the new issn standard iso 3297:2007 as an issn designated by the issn network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media 13 availability the issn register is not freely available for interrogation on the web but is available by subscription there are several routes to the identification and verification of issn codes for the public the print version of a serial typically will include the issn code as part of the publication information most serial websites contain issn code information derivative lists of publications will often contain issn codes these can be found through on-line searches with the issn code itself or serial title worldcat permits searching its catalog by issn by entering issn issn code in the query field one can also go directly to an issn's record by appending it to https www worldcat org issn e g https www worldcat org issn 1021-9749 this does not query the issn register itself but rather shows whether any worldcat library holds an item with the given issn use in urns an issn can be encoded as a uniform resource name urn by prefixing it with urn issn  14 for example rail could be referred to as urn issn:0953-4563 urn namespaces are case-sensitive and the issn namespace is all caps 15 if the checksum digit is x then it is always encoded in uppercase in a urn problems the util urns are content-oriented but issn is media-oriented issn is not unique when the concept is a journal is a set of contents generally copyrighted content the same journal same contents and same copyrights have two or more issn codes a urn needs to point to unique content a unique journal as a set of contents reference examples nature has an issn for print 0028-0836 and another for the same content on the web 1476-4687 only the oldest 0028-0836 is used as a unique identifier as the issn is not unique the u s national library of medicine needed to create prior to 2007 the nlm unique id jid 16 issn does not offer resolution mechanisms like a digital object identifier doi or an urn does so the doi is used as a urn for articles with for historical reasons no need for an issn's existence example the doi name 10.1038 nature13777 can be represented as an http string by https dx doi org 10.1038 nature13777 and is redirected resolved to the current article's page but there is no issn online service like http dx issn org to resolve the issn of the journal in this sample 1476-4687 that is a kind of https dx issn org 1476-4687 redirecting to the journal's home a unique urn for serials simplifies the search recovery and delivery of data for various services including in particular search systems and knowledge databases 13 issn-l see linking issn below was created to fill this gap issn variants and labels there are two most popular media types that adopted special labels indicating below in italics and one in fact issn-variant with also an optional label all are used in standard metadata context like jats and the labels also frequently as abbreviations print issn p-issn is a standard label for print issn the issn for the print media paper version of a serial usually it is the default media so the default issn electronic issn e-issn or eissn is a standard label for electronic issn the issn for the electronic media online version of a serial linking issn issn-l is a unique identifier for all versions of the serial containing the same content across different media as defined by iso 3297:2007 the linking issn issn-l provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource the issn-l is one issn number among the existing issns so does not change the use or assignment of ordinary issns 17 it is based on the issn of the first published medium version of the publication if the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time the issn of the print version is chosen as the basis of the issn-l with issn-l is possible to designate one single issn for all those media versions of the title the use of issn-l facilitates search retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like openurl library catalogues search engines or knowledge bases 18 road road directory of open access scholarly resources it est 2013 produced by the issn international centre and unesco[19 see also
