in the atmosphere 1 the mechanisms through which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those through which mid-latitude cyclogenesis occurs tropical cyclogenesis involves the development of a warm-core cyclone due to significant convection in a favorable atmospheric environment 2 there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures at least 26.5c 80f atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a preexisting low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear 3 tropical cyclones tend to develop during the summer but have been noted in nearly every month in most basins climate cycles such as enso and the maddenjulian oscillation modulate the timing and frequency of tropical cyclone development 4]   [40 over four tropical cyclones have been observed here such as a weak tropical storm in 1991 off the coast of africa near angola hurricane catarina which made landfall in brazil in 2004 at category 2 strength and a smaller storm in january 2004 east of salvador brazil the january storm is thought to have reached tropical storm intensity based on scatterometer wind measurements 41 mediterranean and black seas main article mediterranean tropical-like cyclone the cyclone katie over the extreme southeastern pacific waters in may 2015 storms that appear similar to tropical cyclones in structure sometimes occur in the mediterranean basin examples of these mediterranean tropical cyclones formed in september 1947 september 1969 september 1973 august 1976 january 1982 september 1983 december 1984 december 1985 october 1994 january 1995 october 1996 september 1997 december 2005 september 2006 november 2011 and november 2014 however there is debate on whether these storms were tropical in nature 42 the black sea has on occasion produced or fueled storms that begin cyclonic rotation and that appear to be similar to cyclones seen in the mediterranean 43 elsewhere tropical cyclogenesis is rare in the southeastern pacific ocean due to the cold sea-surface temperatures generated by the humboldt current and to unfavourable wind shear there are no records of a tropical cyclone hitting western south america but in mid-2015 a rare subtropical cyclone was identified in early may relatively close to chile this system was unofficially dubbed katie by researchers 44 vortices have been reported off the coast of morocco in the past however it is debatable if they are truly tropical in character 43 tropical activity is also extremely rare in the great lakes however a storm system that appeared similar to a subtropical or tropical cyclone formed in 1996 on lake huron it formed an eye-like structure in its center and it may have briefly been a subtropical or tropical cyclone 45 influence of large-scale climate cycles see also tropical cyclones and climate change influence of enso loop of sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the tropical pacific main article el nio-southern oscillation el nio enso shifts the region warmer water up and down welling at different locations due to winds in the pacific and atlantic where more storms form resulting in nearly constant accumulated cyclone energy ace values in any one basin the el nio event typically decreases hurricane formation in the atlantic and far western pacific and australian regions but instead increases the odds in the central north and south pacific and particular in the western north pacific typhoon region 46 tropical cyclones in the northeastern pacific and north atlantic basins are both generated in large part by tropical waves from the same wave train 47 in the northwestern pacific el nio shifts the formation of tropical cyclones eastward during el nio episodes tropical cyclones tend to form in the eastern part of the basin between 150e and the international date line idl 48 coupled with an increase in activity in the north-central pacific idl to 140w and the south-central pacific east of 160e there is a net increase in tropical cyclone development near the international date line on both sides of the equator 49 while there is no linear relationship between the strength of an el nio and tropical cyclone formation in the northwestern pacific typhoons forming during el nio years tend to have a longer duration and higher intensities 50 tropical cyclogenesis in the northwestern pacific is suppressed west of 150e in the year following an el nio event 48 influence of the mjo 5-day running mean of mjo note how it moves eastward with time main article maddenjulian oscillation in general westerly wind increases associated with the maddenjulian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all basins as the oscillation propagates from west to east it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season 51 there is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main cause appears to be the phase of the maddenjulian oscillation or mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time 52 influence of equatorial rossby waves main article rossby wave research has shown that trapped equatorial rossby wave packets can increase the likelihood of tropical cyclogenesis in the pacific ocean as they increase the low-level westerly winds within that region which then leads to greater low-level vorticity the individual waves can move at approximately 1.8 m s 4 mph each though the group tends to remain stationary 53 seasonal forecasts since 1984 colorado state university has been issuing seasonal tropical cyclone forecasts for the north atlantic basin with results that are better than climatology 54 the university has found several statistical relationships for this basin that appear to allow long range prediction of the number of tropical cyclones since then numerous others have followed in the university's steps with some organizations issuing seasonal forecasts for the northwest pacific and the australian region 55 the predictors are related to regional oscillations in the
