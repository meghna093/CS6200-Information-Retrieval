meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale a tropical wave exited the coast of africa on october 16 it tracked westward initially without organization and by october 22 was interacting with a trough while approaching the lesser antilles this caused a low pressure area to develop on october 23 about 175 mi 282 km east-northeast of the northern lesser antilles the system continued westward with disorganized convection and was unable to develop further due to strong wind shear 1 despite the shear convection increased as barometric pressures dropped in association with the organizing system 2 turning west-southwestward the low passed over the united states virgin islands on october 25 and just southeast of puerto rico the next day decreasing wind shear on october 27 allowed the thunderstorms to increase over the center late on october 27 after further organization the system developed into tropical depression sixteen at 0000 utc on october 28 about 215 mi 346 km south-southeast of port-au-prince haiti 1 initially the national hurricane center nhc forecast the depression to track west-northwestward brushing southwestern haiti before moving ashore along south-central cuba 3 upon becoming a tropical cyclone the wave was moving to the west-northwest under the steering currents of a high pressure area over the western atlantic ocean 3 six hours after formation the center became difficult to locate 4 though subsequently the depression became much better organized a large area of convection developed over the center with several rainbands to its south 5 based on reports from hurricane hunters the national hurricane center upgraded the depression to tropical storm noel at 1815 utc on october 28 while located about 150 miles 240 km south-southeast of port-au-prince haiti 6 after the center re-developed beneath the thunderstorms the storm quickly strengthened to winds of 60 mph 97 km h 7 and for several hours the cyclone was drifting to the south of hispaniola noel began to lose organization as a nearby upper-level low increased wind shear 8 with the circulation becoming ill-defined as it further interacted with the mountainous terrain of haiti 9 the storm crossed western haiti as a disorganized tropical storm on october 29,     [119 over 70 mm 2.8 in of rainfall was received in some
