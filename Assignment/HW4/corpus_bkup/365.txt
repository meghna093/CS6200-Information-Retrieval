ranking democratic member of the united states house committee on natural resources ral grijalva sent a letter to university of colorado president bruce d benson requesting information on the sources of funding for and communications related to pielke's research and congressional testimony the letter was one of seven grijalva sent to various institutions stemming from concerns about the influence of funding from fossil fuel companies on the work and testimony of harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics researcher willie soon pielke responded that he has no funding from fossil fuel interests and characterized the letter as part of a politically motivated witch-hunt 31 in response to criticism that requesting communications was counter to principles of academic freedom grijalva said he was willing to eliminate that part of the request 32 the heads of some mainstream scientific organizations criticized grijalvas letters margaret leinen the president of the american geophysical union posted in her agu blog that in requiring information only of a few scientists based only on their scientific views grivaljas action was contrary to academic freedom we view the singling out of any individual or group of scientists by any entity  governmental corporate or other  based solely on their interpretations of scientific research as a threat to that freedom [33 the executive director of the american meteorological society wrote in a letter to grvalja that his action sends a chilling message to all academic researchers  and impinges on the free pursuit of ideas that is central to the concept of academic freedom [34 conservative columnist rich lowry editor of the national review noted in an opinion piece that its not that he pielke doubts climate change or even doubts that it could be harmful his offense is merely pointing to data showing that extreme weather events like hurricanes tornadoes and droughts havent yet been affected by climate change this is enough to enrage advocates who need immediate disasters as a handy political cudgel 35 pielke was also named in a letter sent by senator edward markey dma to numerous energy industry groups asking them to disclose the names of scientists they had funded regarding conflict of interest disclosures pielke said that if you look at our community the failure to disclose conflicts of interest is fairly endemic 36
