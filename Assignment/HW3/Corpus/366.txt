atlantic multidecadal oscillation  wikipedianot to be confused with north atlantic oscillation atlantic multidecadal oscillation index according to the methodology proposed by van oldenborgh et al 1880-2013 atlantic multidecadal oscillation index computed as the linearly detrended north atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies 1856-2013 the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo is a climate cycle that affects the sea surface temperature sst of the north atlantic ocean based on different modes on multidecadal timescales 1 while there is some support for this mode in models and in historical observations controversy exists with regard to its amplitude and in particular the attribution of sea surface temperature change to natural or anthropogenic causes especially in tropical atlantic areas important for hurricane development 2 the atlantic multidecadal oscillation is also connected with shifts in hurricane activity rainfall patterns and intensity and changes in fish populations 3 definition the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo was identified by schlesinger and ramankutty in 1994.     [relevant  discuss a 2017 study predicts a continued cooling shift beginning 2014 and the authors note  unlike the last cold period in the atlantic the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies in the atlantic is not uniformly cool but instead has anomalously cold temperatures in the subpolar gyre warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics the tripole pattern of anomalies has increased the subpolar to subtropical meridional gradient in ssts which are not represented by the amo index value but which may lead to increased atmospheric baroclinicity and storminess 3 references further reading andronova n g schlesinger m e 2000 causes of global temperature changes during the 19th and 20th centuries geophys res lett 27 21372140 bibcode:2000georl
