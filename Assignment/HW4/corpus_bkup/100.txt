earth's rotation  wikipediafor the duration of daylight and night see daylight long-exposure photograph of the northern night sky over the nepal himalayas showing the paths of the stars as earth rotates earth's rotation is the rotation of planet earth around its own axis earth rotates eastward in prograde motion as viewed from the north pole star polaris earth turns counterclockwise the north pole also known as the geographic north pole or terrestrial north pole is the point in the northern hemisphere where earth's axis of rotation meets its surface this point is distinct from earth's north magnetic pole the south pole is the other point where earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface in antarctica earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the sun and once every 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to the stars see below earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time thus a day was shorter in the past this is due to the tidal effects the moon has on earth's rotation atomic clocks show that a modern-day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago 1 slowly increasing the rate at which utc is adjusted by leap seconds analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend of 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century bce 2 history among the ancient greeks several of the pythagorean school believed in the rotation of the earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens perhaps the first was philolaus 470385 bce though his system was complicated including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central fire 3 a more conventional picture was that supported by hicetas heraclides and ecphantus in the fourth century bce who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun in the third century bce aristarchus of samos suggested the sun's central place however aristotle in the fourth century bce criticized the ideas of philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation he established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth 4 this was accepted by most of those who came after in particular claudius ptolemy 2nd century ce who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated 5 in 499 ce the indian astronomer aryabhata wrote that the spherical earth rotates about its axis daily and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth he provided the following analogy just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction in the same way to a man at lanka the xed stars appear to be going westward 6]        [49 origin an artist's rendering of the protoplanetary disk the earth's original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust rocks and gas that coalesced to form the solar system this primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the big bang as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas as this interstellar dust is heterogeneous any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet 50 however if the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the moon is correct this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the theia impact 4.5 billion years ago regardless of the speed and tilt of the earth's rotation before the impact it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact 51 tidal effects would then have slowed this
