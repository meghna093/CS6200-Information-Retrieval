meteorology group smg accuracy problems critics such as university of washington professor cliff mass[53 have pointed out that nws forecasts are not as accurate as they could be and that this has resulted in inaccurate daily weather forecasts and dangerously bad predictions concerning the location and intensity of extreme weather events like blizzards and hurricanes certain private companies the british met office the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts ecmwf and the northwest regional modeling consortium in seattle have been cited as producing more accurate predictions in certain circumstances according to critics causes include 54 lack of sufficient computing power to run simulations known to be better including higher-resolution simulations and ensemble forecasts where multiple runs tweak variables slightly to detect low-confidence simulations not using techniques shown to improve accuracy by recent academic research not assimilating data from all available sources such as tamdar data from commercial airliners due to budget cuts this could not be purchased from panasonic weather solutions on an ongoing basis lack of updated equipment on weather satellites lack of focus on a small number of high-quality models compared to the met office and the ecmwf integrated forecast system organizational stovepiping and turf wars resistance to change by powerful employee unions the next generation global prediction system project at nws aims to address some of these criticisms by running a unified high-quality model that takes advantage of more recent research results 55 privatization and dismantling attempts while respected as one of the premier weather organizations in the world the national weather service has been perceived by some conservatives as competing unfairly with the private sector 56 national weather service forecasts and data being works of the federal government are in the public domain and thus available to anyone for free in accordance with united states law from time to time the situation receives official review to ascertain if a leaner more efficient approach may be had by some degree of privatization aborted byrne proposal in 1983 under the administration of president ronald reagan noaa administrator john v byrne announced a proposal to sell all of the agency's weather satellites at auction with the intent to repurchase the weather data from private contractors that would acquire the satellites under the proposal 30 of noaa's workforce would be reviewed for potential layoffs and certain specialty forecasts of agricultural and economic importance would be eliminated noaa also proposed outsourcing of weather observation stations noaa weather radio and computerized surface analysis to private companies the proposal was met with negative reaction among the public members of congress and consumer advocacy groups including most notably ralph nader objecting to the possibility of weather information intended for the public domain being sold to private entities that would profit from the sale of the data the proposal to sell the satellite network failed in a congressional vote while other aspects of the proposal to dismantle portions of noaa's agencies were eventually scuttled 57 failed santorum proposal main article national weather service duties act of 2005 in 2005 pennsylvania senator rick santorum introduced the national weather service duties act of 2005,[58 a bill which would have prohibited the nws from freely distributing weather data the bill was widely criticized by users of the nws's services especially by emergency management officials who rely on the national weather service for information during situations such as fires flooding or severe weather groups such as the aircraft owners and pilots association condemned the bill's restrictions on weather forecasting as threatening the safety of air traffic noting that 40 of all aviation accidents are at least partially weather-related 59 the bill attracted no cosponsors and died in committee during the 2005 congressional session no subsequent attempts have been made to restrict nws
