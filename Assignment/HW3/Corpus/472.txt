across the hudson river in new jersey that the city of new york seriously consider founding a college 34 in 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of new york to raise funds for the foundation of a new college in 1751 the assembly appointed a commission of ten new york residents seven of whom were members of the church of england to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college 35 classes were initially held in july 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president dr samuel johnson 36 dr johnson was the only instructor of the college's

opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777 alexander hamilton 38 the american revolutionary war broke out in 1776 and was catastrophic for the operation of king's college which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the continental army the suspension continued through the military occupation of new york city by british
