railroads in the northeastern united states as lines were washed out and shipments were delayed the erie lackawanna railway el estimated that damage between binghamton and salamanca new york amounted to 2 million el filed for chapter 77 bankruptcy the penn central railroad sustained nearly 20 million in damages the resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed conrail[citation needed the severe floods near lawrenceville pennsylvania were the catalyst for the construction of the tioga reservoir in 1973 the flooding in wilkes-barre pennsylvania and the adjacent town of kingston led to the construction of a levee system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and in the same year was deemed very safe and protective by the army corps of engineers the levee also protected the area from the remnants of tropical storm lee and hurricane irene in 2011 with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure conversely the existing kinzua dam built against the wishes of the seneca nation of new york spared much of western pennsylvania from the worst flooding by filling the allegheny
