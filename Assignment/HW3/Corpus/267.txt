infrared  wikipediafor other uses see infrared disambiguation this infrared space telescope image has false color blue green and red corresponding to 3.4 4.6 and 12 m wavelengths respectively infrared radiation or simply infrared or ir is electromagnetic radiation emr with longer wavelengths than those of visible light and is therefore invisible although it is sometimes loosely called infrared light it extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers frequency 430 thz to 1 millimeter 300 ghz          [48 other important dates include 17 infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by william herschel 1737 milie du chtelet predicted what is today known as infrared radiation in dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu 1835 macedonio melloni made the first thermopile ir detector 1840 john herschel produces the first thermal image thermogram 1860 gustav kirchhoff formulated the blackbody theorem 1873 willoughby smith discovered the photoconductivity of selenium 1878 samuel pierpont langley invents the first bolometer a device which is able to measure small temperature fluctuations and thus the power of far infrared sources 1879 stefan-boltzmann law formulated empirically that the power radiated by a blackbody is proportional to t4 1880s  1890s lord rayleigh and wilhelm wien solved part of the blackbody equation but both solutions diverged in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum this problem was called the ultraviolet catastrophe and infrared catastrophe 1901 max planck published the blackbody equation and theorem he solved the problem by quantizing the allowable energy transitions 1905 albert einstein developed the theory of the photoelectric effect 1917 theodore case developed the thallous sulfide detector british scientist built the first infra-red search and track irst device able to detect aircraft at a range of one mile 1.6 km 1935 lead salts  early missile guidance in world war ii 1938 teau ta  predicted that the pyroelectric effect could be used to detect infrared radiation 1945 the zielgert 1229 vampir infrared weapon system was introduced as the first portable infrared device for military applications 1952 h welker grew synthetic insb crystals 1950s paul kruse at honeywell and texas instruments recorded infrared images 1950s and 1960s nomenclature and radiometric units defined by fred nicodemenus g j zissis and r clark robert clark jones defined d 1958 w d lawson royal radar establishment in malvern discovered ir detection properties of hgcdte 1958 falcon and sidewinder missiles were developed using infrared technology 1961 j cooper demonstrated pyroelectric detection 1964 w g evans discovered infrared thermoreceptors in a pyrophile beetle 37 1965 first ir handbook first commercial imagers barnes agema now part of flir systems inc  richard hudson's landmark text f4 tram flir by hughes phenomenology pioneered by fred simmons and a t stair u s army's night vision lab formed now night vision and electronic sensors directorate nvesd and rachets develops detection recognition and identification modeling there 1970 willard boyle and george e smith proposed ccd at bell labs for picture phone 1972 common module program started by nvesd 1978 infrared imaging astronomy came of age observatories planned irtf on mauna kea opened 32 by 32 and 64 by 64 arrays produced using insb hgcdte and other materials 2013 on february 14 researchers developed a neural implant that gives rats the ability to sense infrared light which for the first time provides living creatures with new abilities instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities 49 see also black-body radiation infrared non-destructive testing of materials infrared solar cells infrared thermometer
