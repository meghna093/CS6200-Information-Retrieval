forecasting weather portal v t e monsoon mnsun is traditionally defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation 1 but is now used to describe seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation associated with the asymmetric heating of land and sea 2]  [33 it is also sometimes called the desert monsoon as a large part of the affected area are the mojave and sonoran deserts however it is debatable whether the north and south american weather patterns with incomplete wind reversal should be counted as true monsoons 6 asia the asian monsoons may be classified into a few sub-systems such as the indian subcontinental monsoon which affects the indian subcontinent and surrounding regions including nepal and the east asian monsoon which affects southern china taiwan korea and parts of japan south asian monsoon main article monsoon of south asia southwest monsoon onset dates and prevailing wind currents of the southwest summer monsoons in india the southwestern summer monsoons occur from july through september the thar desert and adjoining areas of the northern and central indian subcontinent heat up considerably during the hot summers this causes a low pressure area over the northern and central indian subcontinent to fill this void the moisture-laden winds from the indian ocean rush into the subcontinent these winds rich in moisture are drawn towards the himalayas the himalayas act like a high wall blocking the winds from passing into central asia and forcing them to rise as the clouds rise their temperature drops and precipitation occurs some areas of the subcontinent receive up to 10,000 mm 390 in of rain annually the southwest monsoon is generally expected to begin around the beginning of june and fade away by the end of september the moisture-laden winds on reaching the southernmost point of the indian peninsula due to its topography become divided into two parts the arabian sea branch and the bay of bengal branch the arabian sea branch of the southwest monsoon first hits the western ghats of the coastal state of kerala india thus making this area the first state in india to receive rain from the southwest monsoon this branch of the monsoon moves northwards along the western ghats konkan and goa with precipitation on coastal areas west of the western ghats the eastern areas of the western ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the western ghats the bay of bengal branch of southwest monsoon flows over the bay of bengal heading towards north-east india and bengal picking up more moisture from the bay of bengal the winds arrive at the eastern himalayas with large amounts of rain mawsynram situated on the southern slopes of the khasi hills in meghalaya india is one of the wettest places on earth after the arrival at the eastern himalayas the winds turns towards the west travelling over the indo-gangetic plain at a rate of roughly 12 weeks per state citation needed pouring rain all along its way june 1 is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon in india as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state of kerala the monsoon accounts for 80 of the rainfall in india citation needed indian agriculture which accounts for 25 of the gdp and employs 70 of the population is heavily dependent on the rains for growing crops especially like cotton rice oilseeds and coarse grains a delay of a few days in the arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy as evidenced in the numerous droughts in india in the 1990s the monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by city-dwellers as well for it provides relief from the climax of summer heat in june 34 however the roads take a battering every year often houses and streets are waterlogged and slums are flooded despite drainage systems a lack of city infrastructure coupled with changing climate patterns causes severe economic loss including damage to property and loss of lives as evidenced in the 2005 flooding in mumbai that brought the city to a standstill bangladesh and certain regions of india like assam and west bengal also frequently experience heavy floods during this season recently areas in india that used to receive scanty rainfall throughout the year like the thar desert have surprisingly ended up receiving floods due to the prolonged monsoon season the influence of the southwest monsoon is felt as far north as in china's xinjiang it is estimated that about 70 of all precipitation in the central part of the tian shan mountains falls during the three summer months when the region is under the monsoon influence about 70 of that is directly of cyclonic i e monsoon-driven origin as opposed to local convection 35 northeast monsoon monsoon clouds in kolkata around september with the sun fast retreating south the northern land mass of the indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly with this air pressure begins to build over northern india the indian ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still holds its heat this causes cold wind to sweep down from the himalayas and indo-gangetic plain towards the vast spans of the indian ocean south of the deccan peninsula this is known as the northeast monsoon or retreating monsoon while travelling towards the indian ocean the dry cold wind picks up some moisture from the bay of bengal and pours it over peninsular india and parts of sri lanka cities like chennai which get less rain from the southwest monsoon receive rain from this monsoon about 50 to 60 of the rain received by the state of tamil nadu is from the northeast monsoon 36 in southern asia the northeastern monsoons take place from december to early march when the surface high-pressure system is strongest 37 the jet stream in this region splits into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet the subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern asia creating dry air streams which produce clear skies over india meanwhile a low pressure system develops over south-east asia and australasia and winds are directed toward australia known as a monsoon trough east asian monsoon main article east asian monsoon the east asian monsoon affects large parts of indo-china philippines china taiwan korea and japan it is characterised by a warm rainy summer monsoon and a cold dry winter monsoon the rain occurs in a concentrated belt that stretches east-west except in east china where it is tilted east-northeast over korea and japan the seasonal rain is known as meiyu in china jangma in korea and bai-u in japan with the latter two resembling frontal rain the onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over south china and taiwan in early may from may through august the summer monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves northward beginning over indochina and the south china sea may to the yangtze river basin and japan june and finally to north china and korea july when the monsoon ends in august the rain belt moves back to south china australia monsoonal squall nears darwin northern territory australia also known as the indo-australian monsoon the rainy season occurs from september to february and it is a major source of energy for the hadley circulation during boreal winter the maritime continent monsoon and the australian monsoon may be considered to be the same system the indo-australian monsoon it is associated with the development of the siberian high and the movement of the heating maxima from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere north-easterly winds flow down southeast asia are turned north-westerly westerly by borneo topography towards australia this forms a cyclonic circulation vortex over borneo which together with descending cold surges of winter air from higher latitudes cause significant weather phenomena in the region examples are the formation of a rare low-latitude tropical storm in 2001 tropical storm vamei and the devastating flood of jakarta in 2007 the onset of the monsoon over the maritime continent tends to follow the heating maxima down vietnam and the malay peninsula september to sumatra borneo and the philippines october to java sulawesi november irian jaya and northern australia december january however the monsoon is not a simple response to heating but a more complex interaction of topography wind and sea as demonstrated by its abrupt rather than gradual withdrawal from the region the australian monsoon the wet occurs in the southern summer when the monsoon trough develops over northern australia over three-quarters of annual rainfall in northern australia falls during this time europe see also climate of europe the european monsoon more commonly known as the return of the westerlies is the result of a resurgence of westerly winds from the atlantic where they become loaded with wind and rain 38 these westerly winds are a common phenomenon during the european winter but they ease as spring approaches in late march and through april and may the winds pick up again in june which is why this phenomenon is also referred to as the return of the westerlies 39 the rain usually arrives in two waves at the beginning of june and again in mid to late june the european monsoon is not a monsoon in the traditional sense in that it doesn't meet all the requirements to be classified as such instead the return of the westerlies is more regarded as a conveyor belt that delivers a series of low pressure centres to western europe where they create unsettled weather these storms generally feature significantly lower than average temperatures fierce rain or hail thunder and strong winds 40 the return of the westerlies affects europe's northern atlantic coastline more precisely ireland great britain the benelux countries western germany northern france and parts of scandinavia see
