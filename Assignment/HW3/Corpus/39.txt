meteorology severe weather weather forecasting weather portal v t e a tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or in rare cases the base of a cumulus cloud they are often referred to as twisters whirlwinds or cyclones 1 although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which winds blow counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern 2 tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes and they are often visible in the form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour 180 km h are about 250 feet 80 m across and travel a few miles several kilometers before dissipating the most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour 480 km h are more than two miles 3 km in diameter and stay on the ground for dozens of miles more than 100 km 3]                                       [128 the pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken gaps in information about the wind pressure and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere and the computing power available for simulation 129 solar storms similar to tornadoes have been recorded but it is unknown how closely related they are to their terrestrial counterparts 130 gallery a tornado that occurred at seymour texas in april 1979 f4 tornado
