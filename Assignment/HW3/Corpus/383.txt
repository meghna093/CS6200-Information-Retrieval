global warming  wikipediathis page is about the current warming of the earth's climate system climate change can also refer to climate trends at any point in earth's history for other uses see global warming disambiguation global warming also referred to as climate change is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the earth's climate system and its related effects 1]                      :71 emissions can be attributed to different regions attributions of emissions due to land-use change are subject to considerable uncertainty 81] :289 emissions scenarios estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic sociological technological and natural developments 83 in most scenarios emissions continue to rise over the century while in a few emissions are reduced 84]                           :4 pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to take the lead in reducing their emissions 234 this was justified on the basis that the developed world's emissions had contributed most to the cumulation of ghgs in the atmosphere per-capita emissions i e emissions per head of population were still relatively low in developing countries and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs 82]:290 this mandate was sustained in the kyoto protocol to the framework convention 82]:290 which entered into legal effect in 2005. :5 at the 15th unfccc conference of the parties held in 2009 at copenhagen several unfccc parties produced the copenhagen accord 236] :9 aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below 70022751499999999992 c 239 the 16th conference of the parties cop16 was held at cancn in 2010 it produced an agreement not a binding treaty that the parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to 70022751499999999992 c above pre-industrial temperatures it also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of 70022746499999999991.5 c 240 scientific discussion see also scientific opinion on climate change and surveys of scientists views on climate change the discussion continues in scientific articles that are peer-reviewed and assessed by scientists who work in the relevant fields and participate in the intergovernmental panel on climate change the scientific consensus as of 2013 stated in the ipcc fifth assessment report is that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century 241 a 2008 report by the u s national academy of sciences stated that most scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 79 in 2005 the royal society stated that while the overwhelming majority of scientists were in agreement on the main points some individuals and organizations opposed to the consensus on urgent action needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had tried to undermine the science and work of the ipcc 242 national science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions 243 in the scientific literature there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases 244 no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view 245]     [254 on the other hand some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years 255 or even called for policies to reduce global warming 256 global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels 257 surveys of public opinion main article public opinion on climate change the global warming problem came to international public attention in the late 1980s polling groups began to track opinions on the subject at first mainly in the united states 258 the longest consistent polling by gallup in the us found relatively small deviations of 10 or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those unconcerned 259 the first major worldwide poll conducted by gallup in 20082009 in 127 countries found that some 62 of people worldwide said they knew about global warming in the advanced countries of north america europe and japan 90 or more knew about it 97 in the u s 99 in japan in less developed countries especially in africa fewer than a quarter knew about it although many had noticed local weather changes among those who knew about global warming there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities 260 by 2010 with 111 countries surveyed gallup determined that there had been a substantial decrease since 20072008 in the number of americans and europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat in the us just a little over half the population 53 viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families this was 10 points below the 2008 poll 63 latin america had the biggest rise in concern 73 said global warming was a serious threat to their families 261 this global poll also found that people were more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes except in the us where nearly half 47 of the population attributed global warming to natural causes 262 a marchmay 2013 survey by pew research center for the people  the press polled 39 countries about global threats according to 54 of those questioned global warming featured top of the perceived global threats 263 in a january 2013 survey pew found that 69 of americans say there is solid evidence that the earth's average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades up six points since november 2011 and 12 points since 2009.[264 a 2010 survey of 14 industrialized countries found that skepticism about the danger of global warming was highest in australia norway new zealand and the united states in that order correlating positively with per capita emissions of carbon dioxide 265 etymology in the 1950s research suggested increasing temperatures and a 1952 newspaper reported climate change this phrase next appeared in a november 1957 report in the hammond times which described roger revelle's research into the effects of increasing human-caused co2 emissions on the greenhouse effect a large scale global warming with radical climate changes may result both phrases were only used occasionally until 1975 when wallace smith broecker published a scientific paper on the topic climatic change are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming the phrase began to come into common use and in 1976 mikhail budyko's statement that a global warming up has started was widely reported 266 other studies such as a 1971 mit report referred to the human impact as inadvertent climate modification but an influential 1979 national academy of sciences study headed by jule charney followed broecker in using global warming for rising surface temperatures while describing the wider effects of increased co2 as climate change 267 in 1986 and november 1987 nasa climate scientist james hansen gave testimony to congress on global warming there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988 and when hansen testified in the senate on 23 june he sparked worldwide interest 268 he said global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming 269 public attention increased over the summer and global warming became the dominant popular term commonly used both by the press and in public discourse 267 in a 2008 nasa article on usage erik m conway defined global warming as the increase in earths average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases while climate change was a long-term change in the earths climate or of a region on earth  as effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone he considered global climate change a more scientifically accurate term and like the intergovernmental panel on climate change the nasa website would emphasize this wider context 267 see also global warming portal science portal book global warming anthropocene climate change and agriculture effects of global warming on oceans environmental

earth has already experienced almost 1 2 of the 2.0 c 3.6 f described in the cancn agreement in the last 100 years earth's average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 c 1.4 f with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades 23  scientific journals use global warming to describe an increasing global average temperature just at earth's surface and most of these authorities further limit global warming to such increases caused by human activities or increasing greenhouse gases  the greenhouse effect produces an average worldwide temperature increase of about 33 c 59 f compared to black body predictions without the greenhouse effect not an average surface temperature of 33 c 91 f the average worldwide surface temperature is about 14 c 57 f  a rise in
