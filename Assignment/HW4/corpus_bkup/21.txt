cumulonimbus cloud  wikipedia cumulonimbus cloud cumulonimbus abbreviation cb symbol genus cumulonimbus heap storm rain altitude 4607,62012,190 m 1,500  25,000-65,000 ft appearance very tall and large clouds precipitation cloud yes often intense cumulonimbus from the latin cumulus heap and nimbus rainstorm storm cloud is a dense towering vertical cloud[1 associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents if observed during a storm these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads cumulonimbus can form alone in clusters or along cold front squall lines these clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather such as tornadoes cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell cumulonimbus is abbreviated cb appearance towering cumulonimbus clouds are typically accompanied by smaller cumulus clouds the cumulonimbus base may extend several miles across and occupy low to middle altitudes formed at altitude from approximately 200 to 4,000 m 700 to 10,000 ft peaks typically reach to as much as 40,000 ft 12,000 m with extreme instances as high as 70,000 ft 21,000 m or more 2 well-developed cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flat anvil-like top anvil dome caused by wind shear or inversion near the tropopause the shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud's vertical component for many miles and be accompanied by lightning occasionally rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level due to momentum and form an overshooting top culminating at the maximum parcel level when vertically developed this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparison species cumulonimbus calvus cloud with puffy top similar to cumulus congestus which it develops from under the correct conditions it can become a cumulonimbus capillatus cumulonimbus capillatus cloud with cirrus-like fibrous-edged top 3 cumulonimbus calvus a clearly developed cumulonimbus fibrous-edged top capillatus anvil-topped incus

cumulonimbus 6 supplementary features incus species capillatus only cumulonimbus with flat anvil-like cirriform top caused by wind shear where the rising air currents hit the inversion layer at the tropopause 7 mamma or mammatus consisting of bubble-like protrusions on the underside tuba column hanging from the cloud base which can develop into a funnel cloud or tornado they are known to drop

thunderstorm and tornado cumulonimbus storm cells can produce torrential rain of a convective nature often in the form of a rain shaft and flash flooding as well as straight-line winds most storm cells die after about 20 minutes when the precipitation causes more downdraft than updraft causing the energy to dissipate if there is enough solar energy in the atmosphere however on a hot summer's day for example the moisture from one storm cell can evaporate rapidlyresulting in a new cell forming just a few miles from the former one this can cause thunderstorms to last for several hours cumulonimbus clouds can also bring dangerous winter storms called blizzards which bring lightning thunder and torrential snow however cumulonimbus clouds are most common in tropical regions 9 life cycle or stages in general cumulonimbus require moisture an unstable air mass and a lifting force heat in order to form cumulonimbus typically go through three stages the developing stage the mature stage where the main cloud may reach supercell status in favorable conditions and the dissipation stage 10 the average thunderstorm has a 24 km 15 mi diameter depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through 11 towering vertical cumulonimbus capillatus with anvil-shaped incus supplementary feature high layer of cirrus spissatus near top of image cloud types main article list of cloud types clouds form when the dewpoint of water is reached in the presence of condensation nuclei in the troposphere the atmosphere is a dynamic system and the local conditions of turbulence uplift and other parameters give rise to many types of clouds various types of cloud occur frequently enough to have been categorized furthermore some atmospheric processes can make the clouds organize in distinct patterns such as wave clouds or actinoform clouds these are large-scale structures and are not always readily identifiable from a single
