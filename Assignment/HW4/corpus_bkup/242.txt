supercooling  wikipedianot to be confused with superfluidity or subcooling supercooling also known as undercooling 1 is the process of lowering the temperature of a liquid or a gas below its freezing point without it becoming a solid explanation a liquid crossing its standard freezing point will crystalize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid lacking any such nuclei the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs homogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature an amorphous non-crystalline solid will form water normally freezes at 273.15 k 0 c or 32 f but it can be supercooled at standard pressure down to its crystal homogeneous nucleation at almost 224.8 k 48.3 c 55 f 2]  [22 see also amorphous solid pumpable ice technology subcooling ultracold atom viscous liquid freezing rain references further reading debenedetti p g stanley h e 2003 supercooled and glassy water pdf physics today 56 6 4046 bibcode:2003pht 56f 40d doi:10.1063 1.1595053 giovambattista n angell c a sciortino f stanley h e july 2004 glass-transition temperature of water a simulation study pdf physical review letters 93 4 047801 bibcode:2004phrvl 93d7801g pmid 15323794 arxiv cond-mat 0403133 doi:10.1103 physrevlett.93.047801 rogerson m a cardoso s s s april 2004 solidification in heat packs iii metallic trigger aiche journal 49 2 522529 doi:10.1002 aic.690490222 external links supercooled water and coke on youtube supercooled water on youtube super cooled water 2 on youtube supercooled water nucleation experiments on youtube supercooled liquids on arxiv org radiolab podcast on supercooling v t e states of matter list state solid liquid gas  vapor plasma low energy boseeinstein condensate fermionic condensate degenerate matter quantum hall rydberg matter strange matter superfluid supersolid photonic matter high energy qcd matter lattice qcd quarkgluon plasma supercritical fluid other states colloid glass liquid crystal quantum spin liquid magnetically ordered antiferromagnet ferrimagnet ferromagnet string-net liquid superglass transitions boiling boiling point condensation critical line critical point crystallization deposition evaporation flash evaporation freezing chemical ionization ionization lambda point melting melting point recombination regelation saturated fluid sublimation supercooling triple point vaporization vitrification quantities enthalpy of fusion enthalpy of sublimation enthalpy of vaporization latent heat latent internal energy trouton's ratio volatility concepts binodal compressed fluid cooling curve equation of state leidenfrost effect macroscopic quantum phenomena mpemba effect order and disorder physics spinodal superconductivity superheated vapor superheating thermo-dielectric effect v t e glass science topics basics glass glass transition supercooling formulation aginsbte bioglass borophosphosilicate glass borosilicate glass ceramic glaze chalcogenide glass cobalt glass cranberry glass crown glass flint glass fluorosilicate glass fused quartz gesbte gold ruby glass lead glass milk glass phosphosilicate glass photochromic lens glass silicate glass soda-lime glass sodium hexametaphosphate soluble glass tellurite glass thoriated glass ultra low expansion glass uranium glass vitreous enamel wood's glass zblan glass-ceramics bioactive glass corningware glass-ceramic-to-metal seals macor zerodur preparation annealing chemical vapor deposition glass batch calculation glass forming glass melting glass modeling ion implantation liquidus temperature sol-gel technique viscosity vitrification optics achromat dispersion gradient-index optics hydrogen darkening optical amplifier optical fiber optical lens design photochromic lens photosensitive glass refraction transparent materials surface modification anti-reflective coating chemically strengthened glass corrosion dealkalization dna microarray hydrogen darkening insulated glazing porous glass self-cleaning glass sol-gel technique toughened glass diverse topics glass-coated wire safety glass glass databases glass electrode glass fiber reinforced concrete glass ionomer cement glass microspheres glass-reinforced plastic glass-to-metal seal porous glass prince rupert's drops radioactive waste vitrification windshield glass fiber authority control ndl 00565039
