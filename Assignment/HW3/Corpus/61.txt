fog cold wave heat wave jet stream meteorology severe weather weather forecasting weather portal v t e hail is a form of solid precipitation it is distinct from ice pellets american sleet though the two are often confused 1 it consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice each of which is called a hailstone ice pellets american sleet falls generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface temperatures 2 unlike other forms of water ice such as graupel which is made of rime and ice pellets which are smaller and translucent hailstones usually measure between 5 millimetres 0.2 in and 15 centimetres 6 in in diameter the metar reporting code for hail 5 mm 0.20 in or greater is gr while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded gs hail is possible within most thunderstorms as it is produced by cumulonimbus 3 and within 2 nautical miles 3.7 km of the parent storm hail formation requires environments of strong upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm similar to tornadoes and lowered heights of the freezing level in the mid-latitudes hail forms near the interiors of continents while in the tropics it tends to be confined to high elevations there are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms using weather satellites and weather radar imagery hailstones generally fall at higher speeds as they grow in size though complicating factors such as melting friction with air wind and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent through earth's atmosphere severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a damaging size as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures and most commonly farmers crops definition any thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm 4 hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres 0.20 in or more 3 hailstones can grow to 15 centimetres 6 in and weigh more than 0.5 kilograms 1.1 lb 5 unlike ice pellets hailstones are layered and can be irregular and clumped together hail is composed of transparent ice or alternating layers of transparent and translucent ice at least 1 millimetre 0.039 in thick which are deposited upon the hailstone as it travels through the cloud suspended aloft by air with strong upward motion until its weight overcomes the updraft and falls to the ground although the diameter of hail is varied in the united states the average observation of damaging hail is between 2.5 cm 1 in and golf ball-sized 1.75 in 6 stones larger than 2 cm 0.80 in are usually considered large enough to cause damage the meteorological service of canada issues severe thunderstorm warnings when hail that size or above is expected 7 the us national weather service has a 2.5 cm 1 in or greater in diameter threshold effective january 2010 an increase over the previous threshold of -inch hail 8 other countries have different thresholds according local sensitivity to hail for instance grape growing areas could be adversely impacted by smaller hailstones hailstones can be very large or very small depending on how strong the updraft is weaker hailstorms produce smaller hailstones than stronger hailstorms such as supercells formation hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds particularly those with intense updrafts high liquid water content great vertical extent large water droplets and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0 c 32 f 3 these types of strong updrafts can also indicate the presence of a tornado 9 the growth rate is maximized where air is near a temperature of 13 c 9 f citation needed layer nature of the hailstones hail shaft severe thunderstorms containing hail can exhibit a characteristic green coloration     [20 see also graupel ice pellets
