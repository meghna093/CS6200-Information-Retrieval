terangi brought home to serve his sentence under parole but de laage refuses to compromise his stern interpretation of the law despite the pleas of captain nagle father paul c aubrey smith and even his own wife mary astor unable to bear being confined terangi repeatedly tries to escape lengthening his sentence by another 16 years much to the delight of a particularly harsh jailer john carradine

critical reception new york times critic frank s nugent praised the climactic special effect created by james basevi stating it is a hurricane to blast you from the orchestra pit to the first mezzanine it is a hurricane to film your eyes with spin-drift to beat at your ears with its thunder to clutch at your heart and send your diaphragm vaulting over your floating rib into the region just south of your tonsils 2 he complimented the performances of all of the principal actors with the exception of hall whose terangi was described as a competent tarzan 2 nugent also faulted the uneven pacing but in the end characterized the film as one of the most thrilling spectacles the screen has provided this year 2 literary references in his memoir la tregua the truce re-titled the reawakening for publication in the u s  primo levi recounted his experience watching the hurricane among other films while he was interned at a soviet transit camp at starye dorogi in the aftermath of world war ii the audience of soviet troops former prisoners of war and holocaust survivors levi included became more and more unruly as the movie progressed culminating in what levi called a witches sabbath when the actual hurricane appeared on screen a fight broke out in the cramped theater and the projectionist decided to shut off the film before the end to levi's dismay he recalled the film as quite a good american film of the thirties remake a remake of this movie was released in 1979 directed by jan troell and starring jason robards jr and mia farrow dvd the hurricane was released on blu-ray and dvd by kino lorber studio classics in november 2015.[3 references  the 10th academy awards 1938 nominees and winners oscars org retrieved 2011-08-10  a b c frank s nugent november 10 1937 hurricane
