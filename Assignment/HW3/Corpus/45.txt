atlantic hurricane  wikipedia an atlantic hurricane or tropical storm is a tropical cyclone that forms in the atlantic ocean usually in the summer or fall a hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only on the basis of location 1 a hurricane is a storm that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in the south pacific or indian ocean 1 tropical cyclones can be categorized by intensity tropical storms have one-minute maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph 34 knots 17 m s 63 km h while hurricanes have one-minute maximum sustained winds exceeding 74 mph 64 knots 33 m s 119 km h 2 most north atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between june 1 and november 30.          [70 few major hurricanes struck the gulf coast during 30001400 bc and again during the most recent millennium these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 bc and 1000 ad when the gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 35 times this millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the azores high 29 which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the north atlantic oscillation 71 according to the azores high hypothesis an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the gulf of mexico coast and the atlantic coast during the quiescent periods a more northeasterly position of the azores high would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the atlantic coast during the hyperactive period more hurricanes were steered towards the gulf coast as the azores high was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the caribbean such a displacement of the azores high is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in haiti around 3200 14c years bp 30 and a change towards more humid conditions in the great plains during the late-holocene as more moisture was pumped up the mississippi valley through the gulf coast preliminary data from the northern atlantic coast seem to support the azores high hypothesis a 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in cape cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 5001000 years just as the gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium see also tropical cyclones portal 2017 atlantic hurricane season atlantic hurricane seasons south atlantic tropical cyclone list of named tropical cyclones hebert box mediterranean tropical cyclone pacific hurricane typhoon western hemisphere warm pool notes  a major hurricane is a storm that ranks as category 3 or higher on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale 33 references external links tropical cyclone forecasters reference guide nhc tropical cyclone climatology monthly mean sea surface temperatures hurricane preparation guide v t e natural disasters geological earthquakes mass wasting landslides mudflows lahars ice calving volcano eruption avalanches sinkholes quicksands water flood coastal flood flash flood storm surge limnic eruption tsunami cloudburst meteotsunami weather ice cold wave winter storm thundersnow ice storm blizzard ground blizzard snowsquall hail freezing rain whiteout weather black ice cryoseism freezing drizzle ice dam ice jacking jumble ice heat droughts heat waves heat burst backdraft megadrought torridness wind storms storm surge dust storm thunderstorm severe thunderstorm supercell firestorm gale sirocco simoon haboob cyclone mesocyclone tropical cyclones extratropical cyclone subtropical cyclone european windstorm derechos atlantic hurricane typhoon downdraft tornado multiple-vortex tornado landspout waterspout fire whirl gustnado dust devil whirlwind lightning strike air-mass thunderstorm hypercane microburst monsoon fire wildfires firestorm fire whirl health outbreak epidemic pandemic famine space gamma-ray burst fast radio burst cosmic rays ultra-high-energy cosmic ray impact event meteor shower particle shower solar proton event solar flare coronal mass ejection geomagnetic storm astrophysical jet kilonova nova supernova impostor pair-instability supernova supernova hypernova quark-nova stellar collision galactic collision galactic merger v t e cyclones and anticyclones of the world centers of action types extratropical mesocyclone anticyclonic storm polar subtropical cyclone subtropical ridge thermal tropical anticyclones polar high siberian high azores high bermuda north atlantic north american high canadian greenland south atlantic high st helena north pacific high hawaii high south pacific high kalahari high cyclones aleutian low alaska far east russia atlantic hurricane australian low east coast european windstorm genoa low icelandic low kona storm hawaii mediterranean tropical-like cyclone nor'easter pacific hurricane polar vortex typhoon wake low authority control gnd 4160826-4 ndl 00562980
