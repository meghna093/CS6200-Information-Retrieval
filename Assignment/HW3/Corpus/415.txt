list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes  wikipedia a total of 33 recorded tropical cyclones have reached category 5 strength on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale in the atlantic ocean north of the equator the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico hurricanes of such intensity occur once every three years in this region on average only six timesin the 1932 1933 1961 2005 2007 and 2017 hurricane seasonshas more than one category 5 recorded hurricane formed only in 2005 have more than two category 5 hurricanes formed and only in 2007 and 2017 did more than one make landfall at category 5 strength 1 background saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale td ts c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 tracks of all known category 5 atlantic hurricanes between 1851 and 2014 a category 5 atlantic hurricane is one that is considered by the united states national hurricane center nhc to have had sustained wind speeds greater than 136 knots 157 mph 252 km h 70 m s on the saffirsimpson scale the nhc considers sustained wind speeds to be those that occur over a one-minute period at 10 metres 32.8 ft above ground these wind speeds are estimated by using a blend of data from a variety of sources which include observations from nearby ships reconnaissance aircraft or automatic weather stations and pictures from various satellites between 1924 and 2017 33 hurricanes were recorded at category 5 strength no category 5 hurricanes were observed officially before 1924 it can be presumed that earlier storms reached category 5 strength over open waters but the strongest winds were not measured the anemometer a device used for measuring wind speed was invented in 1846 however during major hurricane strikes the instruments as a whole were often blown away leaving the hurricane's peak intensity unrecorded for example as the great beaufort hurricane of 1879 struck north carolina the anemometer cups were blown away when indicating 138 mph 222 km h 2 a reanalysis of weather data is ongoing by researchers who may upgrade or downgrade other atlantic hurricanes currently listed at categories 4 and 5.
