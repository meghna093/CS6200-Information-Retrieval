is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates winter does not occur in tropical climates it occurs after autumn and before spring in each year winter is caused by the axis of the earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the sun different cultures define different dates as the start of winter and some use a definition based on weather when it is winter in the northern hemisphere it is summer in the southern hemisphere and vice versa in many regions winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures the moment of winter solstice is when the sun's elevation with respect to the north or south pole is at its most negative value that is the sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole meaning this day will have the shortest day and the longest night the earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice however and these depend on latitude due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the earth's elliptical orbit see earliest and latest sunrise and sunset etymology the english word winter comes from the proto-indo-european root wend  relating to water 1 cause see also effect of sun angle on climate the tilt of the earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather the earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44 to the plane of its orbit causing different latitudes to directly face the sun as the earth moves through its orbit this variation brings about seasons when it is winter in the northern hemisphere the southern hemisphere faces the sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the northern hemisphere conversely winter in the southern hemisphere occurs when the northern hemisphere is tilted more toward the sun from the perspective of an observer on the earth the winter sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer sun during winter in either hemisphere the lower altitude of the sun causes the sunlight to hit that hemisphere at an oblique angle in regions experiencing winter the same amount of solar radiation is spread out over a larger area this effect is compounded by the larger distance that the light must travel through the atmosphere allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat compared with these effects the changes in the distance of the earth from the sun are negligible the manifestation of the meteorological winter freezing temperatures in the northerly snowprone parallels is highly variable depending on elevation position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation a case in point is canada a country normally associated with tough winters winnipeg on the great plains at a relative distance from large bodies of water has a january high of 11.3 c 11.7 f and a low of 21.4 c 6.5 f 2 in comparison vancouver on the coast with a marine influence from moderating pacific winds has a january low of 1.4 c 34.5 f with days well above freezing at 6.9 c 44.4 f 3 both areas are on the 49th parallel north and in the same western half of the continent a similar effect although with less extreme differentials is found in europe where in spite of the northerly latitude of the islands the british isles has not a single non-mountain weather station with a below-freezing mean temperature 4 meteorological reckoning animation of snow cover changing with the seasons winter in the southern hemisphere in tierra del fuego argentina meteorological reckoning is the method of measuring the winter season used by meteorologists based on sensible weather patterns for record keeping purposes 5 so the start of meteorological winter varies with latitude 6 winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures this corresponds to the months of december january and february in the northern hemisphere and june july and august in the southern hemisphere the coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in january or february in the northern hemisphere and in june july or august in the southern hemisphere nighttime predominates in the winter season and in some regions winter has the highest rate of precipitation as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures precluding evaporation blizzards often develop and cause many transportation delays diamond dust also known as ice needles or ice crystals forms at temperatures approaching 40 f 40 c due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder surface based air 7 they are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape 8 the swedish meteorological institute smhi define winter as when the daily mean temperatures go below 0 c 32 f for five consecutive days 9 according to the smhi winter in scandinavia is more pronounced when atlantic lowpressure systems take more southerly and northerly routes leaving the path open for highpressure systems to come in and cold temperatures to occur as a result the coldest january on record in 1987 was also the sunniest in stockholm 10]   [22 new zealand and south africa winter begins on 1 june and ends on 31 august in celtic nations such as ireland using the irish calendar and in scandinavia the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter with the winter season beginning 1 november on all hallows or samhain winter ends and spring begins on imbolc or candlemas which is 1 or 2 february this system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively the three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during november december and january in the northern hemisphere and may june and july in the southern hemisphere  also many mainland european countries tend to recognize martinmas or st martin's day 11 november as the first calendar day of winter 23 the day falls at midpoint between the old julian equinox and solstice dates also valentine's day 14 february is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring such as flowers blooming in chinese astronomy and other east asian calendars winter is taken to commence on or around 7 november with the jiq known as  l dngliterally establishment of winter the three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late november or early december in the northern hemisphere and lasts through late february or early march this thermological winter is earlier than the solstice delimited definition but later than the daylight celtic definition depending on seasonal lag this period will vary between climatic regions cultural influences such as christmas creep may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years although high latitude countries like canada are usually well into their real winters before the december solstice ecological reckoning and activity the snowshoe hare and some other animals change color in winter ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates it is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term hibernal for this period of the year the other ecological seasons being prevernal vernal estival serotinal and autumnal 24 the hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the earth the appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late january in mild temperate climates to survive the harshness of winter many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for overwintering migration is a common effect of winter upon animals notably birds however the majority of birds do not migratethe cardinal and european robin for example some butterflies also migrate seasonally hibernation is a state of reduced metabolic activity during the winter some animals sleep during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns e g gophers frogs snakes and bats some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely this is the case for squirrels beavers skunks badgers and raccoons resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature the color of the fur or plumage changes to white in order to be confused with snow and thus retains its cryptic coloration year-round examples are the rock ptarmigan arctic fox weasel white-tailed jackrabbit and mountain hare some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur the coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling the heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for trappers who sought more profitable skins snow also affects the ways animals behave many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it mice and voles typically live under the snow layer some annual plants never survive the winter other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle this is known as vernalization as for perennials many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it larger plants particularly deciduous trees usually let their upper part go dormant but their roots are still protected by the snow layer few plants bloom in the winter one exception being the flowering plum which flowers in time for chinese new year the process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called hardening exceptionally cold winters river thames frost fair 1683 16831684 the great frost when the thames hosting the river thames frost fairs was frozen all the way up to the london bridge and remained frozen for about two months ice was about 27 cm 11 in thick in london and about 120 cm 47 in thick in somerset the sea froze up to 2 miles 3.2 km out around the coast of the southern north sea causing severe problems for shipping and preventing use of many harbours 17391740 one of the most severe winters in the uk on record the thames remained frozen-over for about 8 weeks the irish famine of 17401741 claimed the lives of at least 300,000 people 25 1816 was the year without a summer in the northern hemisphere the unusual coolness of the winter of 18151816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of mount tambora in indonesia in april 1815 there were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810 and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814 the cumulative effects were worldwide but were especially strong in the eastern united states atlantic canada and northern europe frost formed in may in new england killing many newly planted crops and the summer never recovered snow fell in new york and maine in june and ice formed in lakes and rivers in july and august in the uk snow drifts remained on hills until late july and the thames froze in september agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the northern hemisphere resulting in food shortages and the worst famine of the 19th century 18871888 there were record cold temperatures in the upper midwest heavy snowfalls worldwide and amazing storms including the schoolhouse blizzard of 1888 in the midwest in january and the great blizzard of 1888 in the eastern us and canada in march in europe the winters of early 1947,[26 february 1956 19621963 19811982 and 20092010 were abnormally cold the uk winter of 19461947 started out relatively normal but became one of the snowiest uk winters to date with nearly continuous snowfall from late january until march in the eastern united states and canada the winter of 20132014 and the second half of february 2015 were abnormally cold however the winter of 20142015 did have a balmy december and a normal january other historically significant winters 13101330 many severe winters and cold wet summers in europe  the first clear manifestation of the unpredictable weather of the little ice age that lasted for several centuries from about 1300 to 1900 the persistently cold wet weather caused great hardship was primarily responsible for the great famine of 13151317 and strongly contributed to the weakened immunity and malnutrition leading up to the black death 13481350 16001602 extremely cold winters in switzerland and baltic region after eruption of huaynaputina in peru in 1600 16071608 in north america ice persisted on lake superior until june londoners held their first frost fair on the frozen-over river thames 1622 in turkey the golden horn and southern section of bosphorus froze over 1690s extremely cold snowy severe winters ice surrounded iceland for miles in every direction 17791780 scotland's coldest winter on record and ice surrounded iceland in every direction like in the 1690s in the united states a record five-week cold spell bottomed out at 20 f 29 c at hartford connecticut and 16 f 27 c in new york city hudson river and new york's harbor froze over 17831786 the thames partially froze and snow remained on the ground for months in february 1784 the north carolina was frozen in chesapeake bay 17941795 severe winter with the coldest january in the uk and lowest temperature ever recorded in london 21 c 6 f on 25 january the cold began on christmas eve and lasted until late march with a few temporary warm-ups the severn and thames froze and frost fairs started up again the french army tried to invade the netherlands over its frozen rivers while the dutch fleet was stuck in its harbor the winter had easterlies from siberia as its dominant feature 18131814 severe cold last freeze-over of thames and last frost fair removal of old london bridge and changes to river's banks made freeze-overs less likely  18831888 colder temperatures worldwide including an unbroken string of abnormally cold and brutal winters in the upper midwest related to the explosion of krakatoa in august 1883 there was snow recorded in the uk as early as october and as late as july during this time period 19761977 one of the coldest winters in the us in decades 1985 arctic outbreak in us resulting from shift in polar vortex with many cold temperature records broken 20022003 was an unusually cold winter in the northern and eastern us 20102011 persistent bitter cold in the entire eastern half of the us from december onward with few or no mid-winter warm-ups and with cool conditions continuing into spring la nia and negative arctic oscillation were strong factors heavy and persistent precipitation contributed to almost constant snow cover in the northeastern us which finally receded in early may 2011 was one of the coldest on record in new zealand with sea level snow falling in wellington in july for the first time in 35 years and a much heavier snowstorm for 3 days in a row in august 20112012 one of the warmest winters christmas day 2011 was the warmest christmas in ireland as observed by the armagh observatory 27 humans and winter humans evolved in tropical climates and met cold weather as they migrated into eurasia although earlier populations certainly encountered southern hemisphere winters in southern africa micro-evolution in caucasian asiatic and inuit people show some adaptation to the climate winter and human health humans are sensitive to cold see hypothermia snowblindness norovirus seasonal depression slipping on black ice and falling icicles are other health concerns associated with cold and snowy weather in the northern hemisphere it is not unusual for homeless people to die from hypothermia in the winter one of the most common diseases associated with winter is influenza symptoms include headache fever
