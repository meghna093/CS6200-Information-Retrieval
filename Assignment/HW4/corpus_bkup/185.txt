tenth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the 2005 season rita formed near the bahamas from a tropical wave on september 18 2005 that originally developed off the coast of west africa it moved westward and after passing through the florida straits rita entered an environment of abnormally warm waters moving west-northwest it rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of 180 mph 285 km h achieving category 5 status on september 21st however as rita approached land through september 24 it weakened to a category 3 and began to curve to the northwest making landfall in johnson's bayou louisiana between sabine pass texas and holly beach louisiana with winds of 120 mph 195 km h rapidly weakening over land rita degenerated into a large low-pressure area over the lower mississippi valley by september 26th in louisiana rita's storm surge inundated low-lying communities along the entire coast worsening effects caused by hurricane katrina less than a month prior such as topping the hurriedly-repaired katrina-damaged levees at new orleans parishes in southwest louisiana and counties in southeast texas where rita made landfall suffered from catastrophic-to-severe flooding and wind damage according to an october 25 2005 disaster center report 4,526 single-family dwellings were destroyed in orange and jefferson counties located in southeast texas major damage was sustained by 14,256 additional single-family dwellings and another 26,211 single-family dwellings received minor damage mobile homes and apartments also sustained significant damage or total destruction 1 in all nine texas counties and five louisiana parishes were declared disaster areas after the storm electric service was disrupted in some areas of both texas and louisiana for several weeks texas

were directly related to the hurricane meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale on september 7 2005 a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of africa and moved westward into the atlantic ocean failing to produce organized deep atmospheric convection 2 the disturbance was not monitored by the national hurricane center nhc for tropical cyclogenesis 3 convection associated with the system increased briefly late on september 13 before dissipating shortly thereafter at roughly the same time a remnant surface trough had developed from a dissipating stationary front and began to drift westward north of the lesser antilles 2 meanwhile the tropical wave slowly became better organized and was first noted in the nhc's tropical weather outlooks on september 15 while northeast of puerto rico 4 the wave merged with the surface trough two days later triggering an increase in convective activity and organization a subsequent decrease in wind shear enabled for additional organization and at 0000 utc on september 18 the nhc estimated that the storm system had organized enough to be classified as a tropical depression 2 the eighteenth disturbance during the hurricane season to do so at the time the disturbance classified as tropical depression eighteen 5 was roughly 80 mi 130 km east of grand turk island in the turks and caicos and had developed banding features 2]           [100 several roads were also flooded in monroe county after 6 inches 150 mm of rain fell 101 winds up to 70 mph 110 km h downed

along the west side of the sabine river from the gulf coast up to toledo bend reservoir saw the greatest measure of damage the worst damage in the state occurred in several counties in southeast texas including jefferson orange hardin jasper newton and tyler counties where damage to electrical and communication services was severe power was not restored in some areas across the region for weeks to even months cities in the golden triangle formed by beaumont port arthur and orange tx sustained extensive wind damage whether directly from wind or collaterally from wind-fallen trees tree branches and or other detritus in beaumont an estimated 25 of the trees in neighborhoods across the city were uprooted or heavily damaged and in groves home of the texas pecan festival about the same percentage of pecan trees suffered similar fates the water treatment plant in port neches was heavily damaged governor rick perry declared a nine-county disaster area as a result of the significant damage in those communities in galveston texas parts of the coast not protected by the sea wall experienced minor storm-surge flooding distressingly at the height of rita's landfall a fire broke out in the strand historic district fortunately the galveston fire department reacted quickly and was able to contain and douse the wind-whipped blaze limiting damage and preventing the fire from spreading throughout the city luckily no serious injuries were reported though several historic buildings were either gutted or damaged a fire-weakened wall of the vacated yaga's cafe and bar

southwest louisiana spared southeast and east texas far greater damage from storm surge in particular texas's coastal communities around galveston bay located to the west of where the storm came ashore were largely protected from rita's storm surge by her fortuitous path however sabine pass experienced a significant storm surge which destroyed much of the community the town was featured on an episode of extreme makeover home edition which built a new fire station in the community the new fire station was later destroyed in hurricane ike which struck the texas coast in 2008 prudently a mandatory evacuation of southeast texas had been issued before rita's landfall by both local and state governments as a result of governor perry's disaster declaration many residents displaced by and

hurricane season's list 118 economic effects projected path of hurricane rita on september 22 highlighting refineries and oil rigs across southeast texas and southern louisiana the heavy concentration of oil infrastructure in the gulf of mexico makes hurricanes of rita's intensity very problematic currently very little spare crude oil capacity exists in the united states and the gulf of mexico produces some 2 million barrels 320,000 m3 per day total as well as having some 30 of the total refining capacity of the united states rita's path traveled through a dense area of offshore pipelines and oil platforms and on land to an area with large refineries with over half of gulf production still shut down in the wake of katrina some economists have stated that a worst-case scenario is for gasoline prices to briefly touch 5 us gallon 1.30 l which would be easily the highest real price for gasoline paid in the united states during the internal combustion era however the oil industry escaped essentially unscathed from the storm and post-storm predictions estimated only minor price rises with some 200,000 jobless claims attributed to katrina rita may have been a further drag on a weakened us economy citation needed the most pessimistic projections had gdp growth cut by 1 on an annualized basis in the united states in the second half of 2005 with as many as 500,000 people made unemployed some economists argued that the rebuilding effort could buoy the economy in 2006 while others argued that the energy spike could decrease consumer confidence by enough to send the economy into a full-fledged recession when combined with the federal reserve's recent increases in interest rates while the above did happen it did not occur until 2008 nearly three years after rita's impact
