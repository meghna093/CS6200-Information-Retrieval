cirrus cloud  wikipedia cirrus cloud classification symbol ci is a genus of atmospheric cloud generally characterized by thin wispy strands giving the type its name from the latin word cirrus meaning a ringlet or curling lock of hair 1] cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals that originate from the freezing of super cooled water droplets in regions where air temperature is lower than 20c or 30c cirrus usually occur in fair weather they are formed when it is high enough to be cold and freeze the water drops into ice they sometimes may be caused by turbulence and wind shear or by upper-tropospheric convection sometimes they are like blown out ice-crystals spreading from the top of a dying cumulonimbus cyclones a vast shield of cirrus clouds accompanying the west side of hurricane isabel cirrus forms from tropical cyclones and is commonly seen fanning out from the eyewalls of hurricanes a large shield of cirrus and cirrostratus typically accompanies the high altitude outflow of hurricanes or typhoons 10 and these can make the underlying rain bandsand sometimes even the eyedifficult to detect in satellite photographs 16 thunderstorms cirrus in an anvil cloud thunderstorms can form dense cirrus at their tops as the cumulonimbus cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically the liquid water droplets freeze when the air temperature reaches the freezing point 17 the anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher thus creating the flat top 18 in the tropics these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils 19 high-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers 18 individual cirrus cloud formations can be the remnants of anvil clouds formed by thunderstorms in the dissipating stage of a cumulonimbus cloud when the normal column rising up to the anvil has evaporated or dissipated the mat of cirrus in the anvil is all that is left 20 contrails contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud formed when water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine condenses on particles which come from either the surrounding air or the exhaust itself and freezes leaving behind a visible trail the exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei when there is an insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere 7 one of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus 21 and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in earth's atmosphere 21]   a process known as the greenhouse effect 32 averaged worldwide cloud formation results in a temperature loss of 5 c 9 f at the earth's surface mainly the result of stratocumulus clouds 33 cirrus fibratus clouds as a result of their warming effects when relatively thin cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming 30 scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase thereby increasing temperatures and humidity this in turn would increase the cirrus cloud cover effectively creating a positive feedback circuit a prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth 7 in addition the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the earth's infrared radiation to balance out 7]    [50 these clouds commonly produce halos and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present 51 they are formed by warm moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude 52 when a warm front approaches cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds 2 and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later 51 extraterrestrial cirrus clouds on mars cirrus clouds have been observed on several other planets on 18 september 2008 the martian lander phoenix took a time-lapse photograph of a group of cirrus clouds moving across the martian sky using lidar 53 near the end of its mission the phoenix lander detected more thin clouds close to the north pole of mars over the course of several days they thickened lowered and eventually began snowing the total precipitation was only a few thousandths of a millimeter james whiteway from york university concluded that precipitation is a component of the martian hydrologic cycle 54 these clouds formed during the martian night in two layers one around 4,000 m 13,000 ft above ground and the other at surface level they lasted through early morning before being burned away by the sun the crystals in these clouds were formed at a temperature of 65 c 85 f and they were shaped roughly like ellipsoids 0.127 millimeters long and 0.042 millimeters wide 55 on jupiter cirrus clouds are composed of ammonia when jupiter's south equatorial belt disappeared one hypothesis put forward by glenn orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it hiding it from view 56 nasa's cassini probe detected these clouds on saturn[57 and thin water-ice cirrus on saturn's moon titan 58 cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on uranus 59 on neptune thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the great dark spot as on uranus these are probably methane crystals 60 interstellar cirrus clouds are composed of tiny dust grains smaller than a micrometer and are therefore not true clouds of this genus which are composed of ice crystals or other frozen liquids 61 they range from a few light years to dozens of light years across while they are not technically cirrus clouds the dust clouds are referred to as cirrus because of their similarity to the clouds on earth they also emit infrared radiation similar to the way cirrus clouds on earth reflect heat being radiated out into space 62 see also cirrus cloud thinning optical phenomena sun halos cloud types sources footnotes  cirrus clouds clouds university of
