[24 a buoy just east of the island recorded a pressure of 921.5 millibars 27.21 inhg as ioke crossed directly over it 25 before the typhoon passed just north of the island an anemometer recorded hurricane-force winds with a peak wind gust of 100 mph 160 km h before the instrument stopped reporting 26 sustained winds were estimated to have reached 155 mph 250 km h with gusts to 190 mph 310 km h 27 the minimum central pressure recorded on the island was 934 mbar at 0906 utc on august 31.[26 the typhoon was expected to produce a storm surge of 18 ft 5.5 m and wave heights of 40 ft 12 m along wake island where the highest point is 20 ft 6.1 m additionally heavy rainfall from the typhoon left buildings flooded with 2 ft 0.61 m of standing water found several days after its passage 28 the powerful winds of typhoon ioke caused extensive damage to the island's power grid leaving most power lines to buildings and backup generators damaged the combination of the winds and storm surge flooding damaged 70 of the buildings in the territory many of which with moderate roof damage all low-lying areas were described as being covered with sea water or sand and the territory was left without running water 28 communications were downed on the island with satellite dishes and cables destroyed 29 damage to the infrastructure was extensive though repairable and less than expected 30 damage on the island was estimated at 88 million 2006 usd 31 japan and alaska the extratropical remnants of ioke over the bering sea west of alaska on september 7 on september 1 the japan meteorological agency ordered the temporary evacuation of its staff on minami-tori-shima under threat of the typhoon the agency expected high waves and winds on the island 32 facilities on the island were damaged although it was repaired and fully operational within three weeks after the storm 33 the extratropical remnant of ioke produced a storm surge and high surf in excess of 30 ft 9.1 m along the southwestern coastline of alaska which coincided with the astronomical high tide the combination led to minor flooding along bristol bay and yukon-kuskokwim delta 34 wind gusts peaked at 84 mph 135 km h in unalaska 35 the system produced moderate to heavy rainfall across the western portion of alaska including daily rainfall records of 1.15 inches 29 mm at bethel and 0.67 in 17 mm at kotzebue rainfall continued into the southeastern portion of the state contributing to above-normal rainfall totals near juneau 36 records and aftermath damage on wake island after ioke hurricane ioke became one of five hurricanes to reach category 5 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale in the central north pacific ocean and the only one originating in the basin with an estimated minimum central pressure of 915 mbar 27.019 inhg the cyclone attained the lowest estimated surface pressure for any hurricane within the basin 1 surpassing the previous minimum set by hurricane gilma in 1994.[37 ioke maintained at least category 4 status for 198 consecutive hours which was the longest continuous time period at that intensity ever observed for any tropical cyclone anywhere on earth 1 additionally the cyclone remained at the equivalence of a super typhoon for 174 consecutive hours which was also a record 25 as a result of its extended duration and intensity hurricane typhoon ioke accrued an accumulated cyclone energy index of 82 which set a new worldwide record 38 the united states coast guard first performed an aerial assessment of damage on wake island on september 2 three days after the typhoon struck the flight indicated an overall damage smaller than expected and reported a lack of oil spill or hazardous material leak the u s coast guard arrived by boat with a team on september 7 with a preliminary damage assessment completed four days later the team repaired a generator to provide power 28 the united states navy's combat stores ship the usns san jose t-afs-7 and sixteen members united states air force's 36th contingency response group at andersen afb guam arrived on september 8 and analyzed the stability of the airfield along with assisting in clean-up efforts and after core tests workers cleared the runway to allow flights onto the territory 39 on september 13 a group of engineers restored power on the island 40 about two weeks after the cyclone several buildings were operational 30 the central pacific hurricane center requested the retirement of the name and in april 2007 the name ioke was retired and replaced with iopa 41 see also tropical
