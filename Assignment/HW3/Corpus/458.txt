bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo it is crested by the white head of an eagle atop a white rope both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency in gold appears on a green background  the eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the nation's increasing demands for energy the sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands the rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities the lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the nation's challenge in harnessing the forces  the color scheme is derived from nature symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of man's existence the blue field represents air and water green represents mineral resources and the earth itself and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces by invoking this symbolism the color scheme represents the nation's commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the preservation of the natural environment  facilities this section does not cite any sources please

for fiscal year fy 2010 including 2.3 billion for the doe office of energy efficiency and renewable energy eere the budget aims to substantially expand the use of renewable energy sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure it also makes significant investments[clarification needed in hybrids and plug-in hybrids in smart grid technologies and in scientific research and innovation 27 as part of the 789 billion economic stimulus package in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 congress provided energy with an additional 38.3 billion for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 adding about 75 percent to energy's annual budgets most of the stimulus spending was in the form of grants and contracts citation needed for fiscal year 2013 each of the operating units of the department of energy operated with the following budgets 28 programs and contracts energy savings performance contract main article energy savings performance contract energy savings performance contracts espcs are contracts under which a contractor designs constructs and obtains the necessary financing for an energy savings project and the federal agency makes payments over time to the contractor from the savings in the agency's utility bills the contractor guarantees the energy improvements will generate savings and after the contract ends all continuing cost savings accrue to the federal agency 29 energy innovation hubs energy innovation hubs are multi-disciplinary meant to advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages of research to the point that the risk level will be low enough for industry to commercialize the technologies 27 the consortium for advanced simulation of light water reactors casl was the first doe energy innovation hub established in july 2010 for the purpose of providing advanced modeling and simulation m&s solutions for commercial nuclear reactors citation needed the 2009 doe budget includes 280 million to fund eight energy innovation hubs each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge two of the eight hubs are included in the eere budget and will focus on integrating smart materials designs and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity another two hubs included in the doe office of science budget were created to tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes yet another hub was made to develop smart materials to allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions 27 in 2012 the doe awarded 120 million to the ames laboratory to start a new eih the critical materials institute which will focus on improving the supply of rare earth elements which is controlled by china 30 advanced research projects agency-energy see also
