list of retired philippine typhoon names  wikipedia since 1963 there have been three agencies who have named tropical cyclones within the north western pacific ocean which has often resulted in a cyclone having two names from 1945 to 2000 the us navy's joint typhoon warning center assigned names to tropical cyclones before the japan meteorological agency jma took over the naming of tropical cyclones in 2000 both agencies assigned names to tropical cyclones when they intensified into a tropical storm since 1963 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa has assigned local names to a tropical cyclone should it move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135e and 115e and between 5n-25n even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it all three agencies that have assigned names to tropical cyclones within the western pacific have retired the names of significant tropical cyclones with pagasa retiring names if a cyclone has caused at least 70091000000000000001 billion in damage and or have caused at least 300 deaths within the philippines since 1963 the naming lists have been revised in 1979 1985 2001 and 2005 for various reasons including to help minimize confusion in the historical records and to remove the names that might have negative associations with real persons 1]                                                      [67 21 names 7011248449994117000248 billion 11332 2236 see also tropical cyclones portal typhoons in the
