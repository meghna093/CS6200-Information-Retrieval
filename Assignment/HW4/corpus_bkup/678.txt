dvorak technique  wikipedia the dvorak technique developed between 1969 and 1984 by vernon dvorak is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity which includes tropical depression tropical storm and hurricane typhoon intense tropical cyclone intensities based solely on visible and infrared satellite images within the dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity the primary patterns used are curved band pattern t1.0-t4.5 shear pattern t1.5t3.5 central dense overcast cdo pattern t2.5t5.0 central cold cover ccc pattern banding eye pattern t4.0t4.5 and eye pattern t4.5t8.0 both the central dense overcast and embedded eye pattern use the size of the cdo the cdo pattern intensities start at t2.5 equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity 40 mph 65 km h the shape of the central dense overcast is also considered the eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself the larger the temperature difference is the stronger the tropical cyclone once a pattern is identified the storm features such as length and curvature of banding features are further analyzed to arrive at a particular t-number the ccc pattern indicates little development is occurring despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature several agencies issue dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors including the national hurricane center's tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb the noaa nesdis satellite analysis branch sab and the joint typhoon warning center at the naval meteorology and oceanography command in pearl harbor hawaii evolution of the method the dvorak technique does not correctly diagnose cyclone intensity for storms like subtropical storm andrea since it applies to tropical cyclones only the initial development of this technique occurred in 1969 by vernon dvorak using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest pacific ocean the system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model as the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone's low-pressure area use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself constraints on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s the central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification as the original estimates were 510 hpa 0.150.29 inhg too low in the atlantic and up to 20 hpa 0.59 inhg too high in the northwest pacific this led to the development of a separate wind-pressure relationship for the northwest pacific devised by atkinson and holliday in 1975 then modified in 1977. [7 for weakening systems the ci is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12 hours though research from the national hurricane center indicates that six hours is more reasonable 8 the table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given t-number 9 the amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per 24hour period is limited to 2.5 t-numbers per day 1 pattern types within the dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity the primary patterns used are curved band pattern t1.0-t4.5 shear pattern t1.5-t3.5 central dense overcast cdo pattern t2.5-t5.0 banding eye pattern t4.0-t4.5 eye pattern t4.5  t8.0 and central cold cover ccc pattern 10 both the central dense overcast and embedded eye pattern utilize the size of the cdo the cdo pattern intensities start at t2.5 equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity 40 miles per hour 64 km h the shape of the central dense overcast is also considered the farther the center is tucked into the cdo the stronger it is deemed 11 tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour 105 km h and 100 miles per hour 160 km h can have their center of circulations obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge 12 the ccc pattern with its large and quickly developing mass of thick cirrus clouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame indicates little development when it develops rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield obscures the circulation center while it resembles a cdo pattern it is rarely seen 10 the eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself the larger the temperature difference is the stronger the tropical cyclone 11 winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the cdo using rapid scan geostationary satellite imagery whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half-hour 13 once a pattern is identified the storm features such as length and curvature of banding features are further analyzed to arrive at a particular t-number 14 usage several agencies issue dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors these include the national hurricane center's tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's satellite analysis branch sab and the joint typhoon warning center at the naval pacific meteorology and oceanography center in pearl harbor hawaii 9 the national hurricane center will often quote dvorak t-numbers in their tropical cyclone products the following example is from discussion number 3 of tropical depression 24 eventually hurricane wilma of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season 15 both tafb and sab came in with a dvorak satellite intensity estimate of t2.5 35 kt however oftentimes the surface wind field of large developing low pressure systems like this one will lag about 12 hours behind the satellite signature therefore the initial intensity has only been increased to 30 kt note that in this case the dvorak t-number in this case t2.5 was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the nhc decided to set the system's intensity the cooperative institute for meteorological satellite studies cimss at the university of wisconsinmadison has developed the objective dvorak technique odt this is a modified version of the dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than subjective human interpretation to arrive at a ci number this is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms 9 the china meteorological agency cma is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of dvorak in the near future the indian meteorological department imd prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum the japan meteorological agency jma uses the infrared version of dvorak over the visible imagery version hong kong observatory and jma continue to utilize dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for 612 hours though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious 8 citizen science site cyclone center uses a modified version of the dvorak technique to categorize post-1970 tropical weather 16 satellite images of selected tropical storms and associated t-number tropical storm wilma at t3.0 tropical storm dennis at t4.0 hurricane jeanne at t5.0 hurricane emily at t6.0 benefits and disadvantages the most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available intensity estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within 5 miles per hour 8.0 km h of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical-storm force 60 miles per hour 97 km h and weak hurricane or typhoon-force 100 miles per hour 160 km h is the least certain its overall precision has not always been true as refinements in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 miles per hour 32 km h the method is internally consistent in that it constrains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the 2.5 t numbers per day limit allowed by the rule which can work to the technique's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s systems with small eyes near the limb or edge of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique which can be resolved through use of polar-orbiting satellite imagery subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using dvorak which led to the development of the hebert-poteat technique in 1975 cyclones undergoing extratropical transition losing their thunderstorm activity see their intensities underestimated using the dvorak technique this led to the development of the miller and lander extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances 1 see also tropical cyclones portal other tools used to determine tropical cyclone
