resistance to acceleration a change in its state of motion when a net force is applied 1 it also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies the basic si unit of mass is the kilogram kg in physics mass is not the same as weight even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses an object on the moon would weigh less than it does on earth because of the lower gravity but it would still have the same mass this is because weight is a force while mass is the property that along with gravity determines the strength of this force in newtonian physics mass can be generalized as the amount of matter in an object however at very high speeds special relativity states that the kinetic energy of its motion becomes a significant additional source of mass thus any stationary body having mass has an equivalent amount of energy and all forms of energy resist acceleration by a force and have gravitational attraction in modern physics matter is not a fundamental concept because its definition has proven elusive there are several distinct phenomena which can be used to measure mass although some theorists have speculated that some of these phenomena could be independent of each other 2 current experiments have found no difference in results regardless of how it is measured inertial mass measures an object's resistance to being accelerated by a force represented by the relationship f  ma active gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted by an object passive gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted on an object in a known gravitational field the mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied force the inertia and the inertial mass describe the same properties of physical bodies at the qualitative and quantitative level respectively by other words the mass quantitatively describes the inertia according to newton's second law of motion if a body of fixed mass m is subjected to a single force f its acceleration a is given by f m a body's mass also determines the degree to which it generates or is affected by a gravitational field if a first body of mass ma is placed at a distance r center of mass to center of mass from a second body of

mass note 1 repeated experiments since the 17th century have demonstrated that inertial and gravitational mass are identical since 1915 this observation has been entailed a priori in the equivalence principle of general relativity units of mass further information orders of magnitude mass the standard international system of units si unit of mass is the kilogram kg the kilogram is 1000 grams g first defined in 1795 as one cubic decimeter of water at the melting point of ice then in 1889 the kilogram was redefined as the mass of the international prototype kilogram and as such is independent of the meter or the properties of water however the mass of the international prototype and its identical national copies have been found to be drifting over time it is expected that the re-definition of the kilogram and several other units will change on may 20 2019 following a final vote by the cgpm in november 2018. :31 isaac newton had bridged the gap between keplers gravitational mass and galileos gravitational acceleration resulting in the discovery of the following relationship which governed both of these where g is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of space where gravitational fields exist  is the gravitational mass standard gravitational parameter of the body causing gravitational fields and r is the radial coordinate the distance between the centers of the two bodies by finding the exact relationship between a body's gravitational mass and its gravitational field newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass the mass of the earth can be determined using kepler's method from the orbit of earth's moon or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the earth's surface and multiplying that by the square of the earth's radius the mass of the earth is approximately three millionths of the mass of the sun to date no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered 18 newton's cannonball a cannon on top of a very high mountain shoots a cannonball horizontally if the speed is low the cannonball quickly falls back to earth a b at intermediate speeds it will revolve around earth along an elliptical orbit c d at a sufficiently high speed it will leave the earth altogether e main article newton's cannonball newton's cannonball was a thought experiment used to bridge the gap between galileo's gravitational acceleration and kepler's elliptical orbits it appeared in newton's 1728 book a treatise of the system of the world according to galileo's concept of gravitation a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the earth however newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally meaning sideways or perpendicular to earth's gravity it follows a curved path for a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path which by the projection alone it should have pursued and made to describe a curve line in the air and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground and the greater the velocity is with which it is projected the farther it goes before it falls to the earth 17]:513 newton further reasons that if an object were projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain with sufficient velocity it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the earth and return to the mountain from which it was projected citation needed universal gravitational mass an apple experiences gravitational fields directed towards every part of the earth however the sum total of these many fields produces a single gravitational field directed towards the earth's center in contrast to earlier theories e g celestial spheres which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material newton's theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced universal gravitational mass every object has gravitational mass and therefore every object generates a gravitational field newton further assumed that the strength of each object's gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object if a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the earth or sun newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body 17]:397 and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body's center 17]:221           [39 under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories  the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals there is no violation of causality 40 while the field may have imaginary mass any physical particles do not the imaginary mass shows that the system becomes unstable and sheds the instability by undergoing a type of phase transition called tachyon condensation closely related to second order phase transitions that results in symmetry breaking in current models of particle physics the term tachyon was coined by gerald feinberg in a 1967 paper 41 but it was soon realized that feinberg's model in fact did not allow for superluminal speeds 40 instead the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration  any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons this process is known as tachyon condensation well known examples include the condensation of the higgs boson in particle physics and ferromagnetism in condensed matter physics although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass the mass is not quantized rather the scalar field is even for tachyonic quantum fields the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute or anticommute thus preserving causality therefore information still does not propagate faster than light 41 and solutions grow exponentially but not superluminally there is no violation of causality tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared 42 this is a special case of the general rule where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a complex mass with the real part being their mass in the usual sense and the imaginary part being the decay rate in natural units 42 however in quantum field theory a particle a one-particle state is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time i e an eigenvalue of the hamiltonian an unstable particle is a state which is only approximately constant over time if it exists long enough to be measured it can be formally described as having a complex mass with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part if both parts are of the same magnitude this is interpreted as a resonance appearing in a scattering process rather than a particle as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process in the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it in a lorentz invariant theory the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles sometimes called bradyons in discussions of tachyons must also apply to tachyons in particular the energymomentum relation where p is the relativistic momentum of the bradyon and m is its rest mass should still apply along with the formula for the total energy of a particle this equation shows that the total energy of a particle bradyon or tachyon contains a contribution from its rest mass the rest massenergy and a contribution from its motion the kinetic energy when v is larger than c the denominator in the equation for the energy is imaginary as the value under the radical is negative because the total energy must be real the numerator must also be imaginary i e the rest mass m must be imaginary as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number exotic matter and negative mass main article negative mass the negative mass exists in the model to describe dark energy phantom energy and radiation in negative-index metamaterial in a unified way 43 in this way the negative mass is associated with negative momentum negative pressure negative kinetic energy and ftl faster-than-light

when a distinction is necessary m is used to denote the active gravitational mass and m the passive gravitational mass  since the avogadro constant na is defined as the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12 it follows that 1 u is exactly 1  103na kg  the distinction between active and passive gravitational mass does not exist in the newtonian view of gravity as found in classical mechanics and can safely be ignored for many purposes in most practical applications newtonian gravity is assumed because it is usually sufficiently accurate and is simpler than general relativity for example nasa uses primarily newtonian gravity to design space missions although accuracies are routinely enhanced by accounting for tiny relativistic effects www2.jpl nasa gov basics bsf3-2.php the distinction between active and passive is very abstract and applies to post-graduate level applications of general relativity to certain problems in cosmology and is otherwise not used there is nevertheless an important conceptual distinction in newtonian physics between inertial mass and gravitational mass although these quantities are identical the conceptual distinction between these two fundamental definitions of mass is maintained for teaching purposes because they involve two distinct methods of measurement it was long considered anomalous that the two distinct measurements of mass inertial and gravitational gave an identical result the property observed by galileo that objects of different mass fall with the same rate of acceleration ignoring air resistance shows that inertial and gravitational mass are the same  this constant ratio was later shown to be a direct measure of the sun's active gravitational mass it has units of distance cubed per time squared and is known as the standard gravitational parameter  at the time when viviani asserts that the experiment took place galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall he had however formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies of the same material falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed see drake s 1978 galileo at work university of chicago press pp 1920 isbn 0-226-16226-5  these two properties are very useful as they allow spherical collections of objects to be treated exactly like large individual objects  in its original form newton's second law is valid only for bodies of constant mass  it is possible to make a slight distinction between rest mass and invariant mass for a system of two or more particles none of the particles are required be at rest with respect to the observer for the system as a whole to be at rest with respect to the observer to avoid this confusion some sources will use rest mass only for individual particles and invariant mass for systems  for example a nuclear bomb in an idealized super-strong box sitting on a scale would in theory show no change in mass when detonated although the inside of the box would become much hotter in such a system the mass of the box would change only if energy were allowed to escape from the box as light or heat however in that case the removed energy would take its associated mass with it letting heat or radiation out of such a system is simply a way to remove mass thus mass like energy cannot be destroyed but only moved from one place to another references
