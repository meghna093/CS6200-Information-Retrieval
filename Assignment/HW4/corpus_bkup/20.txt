cloud  wikipediafor other uses see cloud disambiguation in meteorology a cloud is an aerosol comprising a visible mass of minute liquid droplets frozen crystals or particles suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body 1 the droplets and crystals may be made of water or various chemicals on earth clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point or when it gains sufficient moisture usually in the form of water vapor from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature they are seen in the earth's homosphere which includes the troposphere stratosphere and mesosphere nephology is the science of clouds which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology there are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the atmosphere latin and common cloud types in the troposphere the atmospheric layer closest to earth's surface have latin names due to the universal adaptation of luke howard's nomenclature formally proposed in 1802 it became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms that appear in any or all of three altitude levels formerly known as tages these physical types in approximate ascending order of convective activity include stratiform sheets cirriform wisps and patches stratocumuliform layers mainly structured as rolls ripples and patches cumuliform heaps and very large cumulonimbiform heaps that often show complex structure the physical forms are divided by altitude level into ten basic genus-types the latin names for applicable high-level genera carry a cirro prefix and an alto prefix is added to the names of the mid-level genus-types most of the genera can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties two cirriform clouds that form higher up in the stratosphere and mesosphere have common names for their main types they are seen infrequently mostly in the polar regions of earth clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the solar system and beyond however due to their different temperature characteristics they are often composed of other substances such as methane ammonia and sulfuric acid as well as water taken as a whole homospheric clouds can be cross-classified by form and level to derive the ten tropospheric genera and the two additional major types above the troposphere the cumulus genus includes three species that indicate vertical size clouds with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one altitude level are officially classified as low or mid-level according to the altitude range at which each initially forms however they are also more informally classified as multi-level or vertical play media time-lapse video of clouds at sunset in japan etymology and history of cloud science and nomenclature main article timeline of meteorology etymology the origin of the term cloud can be found in the old english clud or clod meaning a hill or a mass of rock around the beginning of the 13th century it was extended as a metaphor to include rain clouds as masses of evaporated water in the sky because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and a cumulus heap cloud over time the metaphoric term replaced the original old english weolcan to refer to clouds in
