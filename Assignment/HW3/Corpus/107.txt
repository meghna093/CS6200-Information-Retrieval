coriolis force  wikipediafor the psychophysical perception effect see coriolis effect perception in physics the coriolis force is an inertial force              [67 lagrangian point stability in astronomy lagrangian points are five positions in the orbital plane of two large orbiting bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two large bodies the first three lagrangian points l1 l2 l3 lie along the line connecting the two large bodies while the last two points l4 and l5 each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies the l4 and l5 points although they correspond to maxima of the effective potential in the coordinate frame that rotates with the two large bodies are stable due to the coriolis effect 69 the stability can result in orbits around just l4 or l5 known as tadpole orbits where trojans can be found it can also result in orbits that encircle l3 l4 and l5 known as horseshoe orbits see also physics portal
