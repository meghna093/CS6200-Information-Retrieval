[86 this daily dose is approximately that received from natural background radiation on earth in two years 87 the radiation environment of the station was not uniform closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased radiation dose and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules kvant-2's being better than the core module for instance 88 the increased radiation levels pose a higher risk of crews developing cancer and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes these cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts over time lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members especially in such confined areas radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks 38 at the low altitudes at which mir orbited there is a variety of space debris consisting of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites to explosion fragments paint flakes slag from solid rocket motors 89 coolant released by rorsat nuclear powered satellites 90 small needles and many other objects these objects in addition to natural micrometeoroids 91 posed a threat to the station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage to other parts of the station such as the solar arrays 92 micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts as such objects could puncture their spacesuits causing them to depressurise 93 meteor showers in particular posed a risk and during such storms the crews slept in their soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should mir be damaged 17 in media mir modified to have artificial gravity by rotating on itself appears in the 1998 film armageddon as it is involved in a world-saving mission
