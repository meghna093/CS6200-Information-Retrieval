as a bare number or a quantity of dimension one   [6 pure numbers all pure numbers are dimensionless quantities for example 1 i  e and  7 units of number such as the dozen gross googol and avogadro's number may also be considered dimensionless ratios proportions and angles dimensionless quantities are often obtained as ratios of quantities that are not dimensionless but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation 8 examples include calculating slopes or unit conversion factors a more complex example of such a ratio is engineering strain a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length since both quantities have the dimension length their ratio is dimensionless another set of examples is mass fractions or mole fractions often written using parts-per notation such as ppm  106 ppb  109 and ppt  1012 or more confusingly as ratios of two identical units kg kg or mol mol for example alcohol by volume which characterizes the concentration of ethanol in an alcoholic beverage could be written as ml  100 ml other common proportions are percentages   0.01   0.001 and angle units such as radians degrees and grads in statistics the coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is used to measure the dispersion in the data buckingham  theorem the buckingham  theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system a statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an identity involving only dimensionless combinations ratios or products of the variables linked by the law e g pressure and volume are linked by boyle's law  they are inversely proportional if the dimensionless combinations values changed with the systems of units then the equation would not be an identity and buckingham's theorem would not hold another consequence of the theorem is that the functional dependence between a certain number say n of variables can be reduced by the number say k of independent dimensions occurring in those variables to give a set of p  n  k independent dimensionless quantities for the purposes of the experimenter different systems that share the same description by dimensionless quantity are equivalent example to demonstrate the application of the  theorem consider the power consumption of a stirrer with a given shape the power p in dimensions m  l2 t3 is a function of the density  m l3 and the viscosity of the fluid to be stirred  m  l  t as well as the size of the stirrer given by its diameter d l and the angular speed of the stirrer n 1 t therefore we have a total of n  5 variables representing our example those n  5 variables are built up from k  3 fundamental dimensions the length l si units m time t s and mass m kg according to the -theorem the n  5 variables can be reduced by the k  3 dimensions to form p  n  k  5  3  2 independent dimensionless numbers these quantities are commonly named the reynolds number which describes the fluid flow regime and the power number which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer dimensionless physical constants main article dimensionless physical constant certain fundamental physical constants such as the speed of light in a vacuum the universal gravitational constant planck's constant and boltzmann's constant can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for time length mass charge and temperature are chosen the resulting system of units is known as the natural units however not all physical constants can be normalized in this fashion for example the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units and must be determined experimentally 9   1 137 the fine structure constant which characterizes the magnitude of the electromagnetic interaction between electrons  or   1836 the proton-to-electron mass ratio this ratio is the rest mass of the proton divided by that of the electron an analogous ratio can be defined for any elementary particle s a constant characterizing the strong force g  1.75  1045 the gravitational coupling constant which characterizes the magnitude of the gravitational interaction between electrons other quantities produced by nondimensionalization main article list of dimensionless quantities physics often uses dimensionless quantities to simplify the characterization of systems with multiple interacting physical phenomena these may be found by applying the buckingham  theorem or otherwise may emerge from making partial differential equations unitless by the process of nondimensionalization engineering economics and other fields often extend these ideas in design and analysis of the relevant systems physics and engineering fresnel number  wavenumber over distance reynolds number is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize flow incorporating both properties of the fluid and the flow it is interpreted as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and can indicate flow regime as well as correlate to frictional heating in application to flow in pipes 10 mach number  ratio of the speed of an object or flow relative to the speed of sound in the fluid further information dimensionless numbers in fluid mechanics beta plasma physics  ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure used in magnetospheric physics as well as
