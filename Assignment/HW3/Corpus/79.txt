[33 the number of heat fatalities is likely highly underreported due to lack of reports and misreports 23 part of the mortality observed during a heat wave however can be attributed to a so-called harvesting effect a term for a short-term forward mortality displacement it has been observed that for some heat waves there is a compensatory decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks after a heat wave such compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that heat affects especially those so ill that they would have died in the short term anyway 34 another explanation for underreporting is the social attenuation in most contexts of heat waves as a health risk as shown by the deadly french heat wave in 2003 heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors 35 psychological and sociological effects in addition to physical stress excessive heat causes psychological stress to a degree which affects performance and is also associated with an increase in violent crime 36 high temperatures are associated with increased conflict both at the interpersonal level and at the societal level in every society crime rates go up when temperatures go up particularly violent crimes such as assault murder and rape furthermore in politically unstable countries high temperatures are an aggravating factor that lead toward civil wars 37 additionally high temperatures have a significant effect on income a study of counties in the united states found that economic productivity of individual days declines by about 1.7 for each degree celsius above 15c 59f 38 power outages abnormally hot temperatures cause electricity demand to increase during the peak summertime hours of 4 to 7 p m when air conditioners are straining to overcome the heat if a hot spell extends to three days or more however nighttime temperatures do not cool down and the thermal mass in homes and buildings retains the heat from previous days this heat build-up causes air conditioners to turn on earlier and to stay on later in the day as a result available electricity supplies are challenged during a higher wider peak electricity consumption period heat waves often lead to electricity spikes due to increased air conditioning use which can create power outages exacerbating the problem during the 2006 north american heat wave thousands of homes and businesses went without power especially in california in los angeles electrical transformers failed leaving thousands without power for as long as five days 39 the 2009 south eastern australia heat wave caused the city of melbourne australia to experience some major power disruptions which left over half a million people without power as the heat wave blew transformers and overloaded a power grid wildfires if a heat wave occurs during a drought which dries out vegetation it can contribute to bushfires and wildfires during the disastrous heat wave that struck europe in 2003 fires raged through portugal destroying over 3,010 square kilometres 1,160 sq mi or 301,000 hectares 740,000 acres of forest and 440 square kilometres 170 sq mi or 44,000 hectares 110,000 acres of agricultural land and causing an estimated 1 billion worth of damage 40 high end farmlands have irrigation systems to back up crops with physical damage heat waves can and do cause roads and highways to buckle and melt 41 water lines to burst and power transformers to detonate causing fires see the 2006 north american heat wave article about heat waves causing physical damage heat waves can also damage rail roads such as buckling and kinking rails which can lead to slower traffic delays and even cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains sun kinking is caused when certain types of rail design like short section rails welded together or fish plate rails expand and push on other sections of rail causing them to warp and kink sun kinking can be a serious problem in hotter climates like southern usa parts of canada the middle east etc in the 2013 heatwave in england gritters normally only seen in snow were sent out to grit melting tarmac roads see also
