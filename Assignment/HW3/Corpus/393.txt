disruption other works such as names on the land and american ways of life offer other unique insights and perspectives not found anywhere else taken together this enlightening body of work provides a breadth and depth of perspective found elsewhere only in authors like toynbee the durants and carroll quigley but in a far more palatable and accessible form achievements of this stature should have
