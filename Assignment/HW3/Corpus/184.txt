katrina at peak intensity in the gulf of mexico on august 28 2005 formed august 23 2005 dissipated august 31 2005                      [166 in the year following katrina's strike on the gulf coast the salvation army allocated donations of more than 365 million to serve more than 1.7 million people in nearly every state the organization's immediate response to hurricane katrina included more than 5.7 million hot meals and about 8.3 million sandwiches snacks and drinks served in and around new orleans its satern network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors salvation army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals as part of the overall effort salvation army officers employees and volunteers contributed more than 900,000 hours of service 167 analysis of new orleans levee failures main article 2005 levee failures in greater new orleans view of the eyewall of hurricane katrina taken on august 28 2005 as seen from a noaa wp-3d hurricane hunter aircraft before the storm made landfall on the united states gulf coast on april 5 2006 months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength lieutenant general carl strock chief of engineers and commander of the corps of engineers testified before the united states senate subcommittee on energy and water that we have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure 168 a june 2007 report released by the american society of civil engineers determined that the failures of the levees and floodwalls in new orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design and construction flaws 47 the us army corps of engineers is federally mandated in the flood control act of 1965 with responsibility for the conception design and construction of the region's flood-control system according to report published in august 2015 in the official journal of the world water council the corps misinterpreted the results of a 1985 study and wrongly concluded that sheet piles in the flood walls needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet 5 m instead of between 31 and 46 feet 9 and 14 m that decision saved approximately us 100 million but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability 169 other factors may have contributed to the flooding according to the authors of catastrophe in the making island press 2009 the straight design and lack of outward flow into the gulf allowed the mississippi river-gulf outlet canal to become the perfect shortcut for salt-water intrusion which damaged buffering cypress forests and wetlands which historically had protected new orleans from storm surge 170 the army corps of engineers built and maintained the canal furthermore according to storm surge researcher hassan mashriqui storm surge pushing across shallow lake borgne from the east is constrained by these mrgo levees to the south and to the north by the long-standing levees of the intracoastal waterway giww initially ten or more miles apart these two channels meet and when they do the water building between their levees is squeezed into a single channel  the funnel  only 260 yards wide constrained by levees 14 feet to 16 feet high in concert with the denuded marshes it could increase the local storm surge hitting the intracoastal waterway by 20 percent to 40 percent  a critical and fundamental flaw 171 the corps of engineers disputes these causalities 172 nonetheless in june 2008 the army corps of engineers new orleans district submitted a deep-draft de-authorization study of the mrgo which stated that an economic evaluation of channel navigation use does not demonstrate a federal interest in continued operation and maintenance of the channel  congress ordered the mrgo closed as a direct result many of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of katrina in reconstructing them precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety for example in every situation possible the corps of engineers replaced i-walls with t-walls t-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls 173 however there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements in february 2008 the bush administration requested that the state of louisiana pay about 1.5 billion of an estimated 7.2 billion for corps of engineers levee work in accordance with the principles of local cost sharing required by congress as early as the flood control act of 1928 a proposal which angered many louisiana leaders 174 on may 2 2008 louisiana gov bobby jindal used a speech to the national press club to request that president bush free up money to complete work on louisiana's levees bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill which would pass sooner 175 media involvement main article media coverage of hurricane katrina many representatives of the news media reporting on the aftermath of hurricane katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events instead of simply reporting because of the loss of most means of communication such as land-based and cellular telephone systems field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities the authorities who monitored local and network news broadcasts as well as internet sites would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports one illustration was when geraldo rivera of fox news tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the ernest n morial convention center 176 the role of am radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news providing emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims immediately after katrina wwl-am was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air this emergency service simulcasted on shortwave outlet whri was named the united radio broadcasters of new orleans  their ongoing nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to 500 mi 800 km away announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios 177 the cellular phone antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months the storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of internet sitesespecially blogging and community journalism one example was the effort of nola com the web affiliate of new orleans times-picayune a group of reporters were awarded the breaking news pulitzer prize 178 and shared the public service pulitzer with the biloxi-based sun herald 179 the newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on nola's blogs as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on august 30 the site became an international focal point for news by local media and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums nola was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teamsfrom individuals to the coast guardwhich used information in rescue efforts much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the sms functions of their cell phones to friends and relatives outside the area who then relayed the information back to nola com the aggregation of community journalism user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention and was called a watershed moment in journalism 180 in the wake of these online-only efforts the pulitzer committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries 181 as the u s military and rescue services regained control over the city there were restrictions on the activity of the media on september 9 the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have zero access to efforts to recover bodies in new orleans immediately following this announcement cnn filed a lawsuit and obtained a temporary restraining order against the ban the next day the government backed down and reversed the ban 182 retirement see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names because of the large death toll and destruction of property along the gulf coast the name katrina was officially retired on april 6 2006 by the world meteorological organization at the request of the u s government the name will never again be used for another north atlantic hurricane it was replaced by katia on list iii of the atlantic hurricane naming lists which was used in the 2011 atlantic hurricane season 183 studies concerning post-katrina victims an article published in the community mental health journal from january 2016 revealed information about a recent study on the psychosocial needs of hurricane katrina evacuees that temporarily resided in dallas texas more than one-fourth of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder mdd about one-third of the individuals received a referral to mental health services for meeting symptom criteria for incident mdd and ptsd 184 in a study published in maternal and child health journal five-to seven years after the disaster 308 new orleans pregnant women were interviewed about their exposure to katrina researchers found that there were associations between experiencing damage during katrina and birthweight thus researchers concluded that natural disasters may have long-term effects on pregnancy outcomes furthermore it was concluded that women who are most vulnerable to disaster may be more vulnerable to poor pregnancy outcome 185 from a september 2015 journal of current psychology a study examined the attitudes of older long-term residents of baton rouge louisiana toward displaced newcomers to their community after using multiple tests analyses and descriptive statistics the study suggested residents grew to become more patient tolerant and friendly towards newcomers the study also suggests however that residents felt more fearful and suspicious of the evacuees as well as the fact that they were being taken advantage of more 186 reconstruction main article reconstruction of new orleans volunteers from americorps in new
