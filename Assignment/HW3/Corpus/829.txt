tobago leeward antilles venezuela colombia mexico socorro island panama guatemala el salvador part of the 1996 atlantic and pacific hurricane seasons hurricane cesardouglas was one of the few tropical cyclones to survive the crossover from the atlantic to east pacific basin and was the last to receive two names upon doing so cesar was the third named storm and second hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season the system formed in the southern caribbean sea and affected several countries in south america before crossing nicaragua and entering the eastern pacific where it was renamed douglas the storm killed 113 people in central and south america and left 29 others missing mainly due to flooding and mudslides meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale the origins of hurricane cesar were from a tropical wave and an elongated area of low pressure that emerged into the atlantic from the west coast of africa on july 17 for several days the wave moved westward without any organization although an anticyclone aloft provided conditions favorable for development on july 22 convection or thunderstorms increased along the wave as it approached the southern windward islands surface pressure steadily dropped as the system moved through the lesser antilles and a circulation began developing near trinidad and tobago based on surface and satellite data it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression three at 1800 utc on july 24 near isla margarita off the north coast of venezuela 1 operationally the national hurricane center nhc did not consider it as a tropical depression until 18 hours later 1][2 with an unusually strong high pressure area located over the bahamas the tropical depression moved westward through the southern caribbean near the northern coast of south america around 1200 utc on july 25 it struck the island of curaao which reported sustained winds of 45 mph 75 km h the observation indicated the depression attained tropical storm status 1 although operationally the depression wasn't upgraded until the next day at which point the nhc named the storm cesar 2 after crossing curaao the storm moved near or over guajira peninsula in extreme northern colombia its proximity to south america prevented significant strengthening until late on july 26 when the storm reached the open waters of the southwest caribbean sea 1 on july 27 cesar attained hurricane status about halfway between nicaragua and colombia later that day the hurricane passed over san andrs island which is part of a small colombian archipelago off the east coast of nicaragua as cesar approached central america a 17 mile 19 km eye formed surrounded by deep convection in the form of an eyewall at about 0400 utc on july 28 hurricane cesar made landfall just north of bluefields nicaragua with winds of 75 mph 140 km h it moved quickly west-northward through the country weakening to tropical storm status and emerging into the eastern pacific ocean by july 29.[1 this made cesar the most recent tropical cyclone to traverse from the atlantic to east pacific basin until otto achieved the same feat in 2016.[3 in addition following the dissipation of cesardouglas there was a policy change which determined that future storms would retain their original name upon crossing into another basin 4 upon reaching the pacific the system was renamed tropical depression seven-e 5 but in a post-analysis it was determined the cyclone maintained tropical storm status while crossing central america 1 once its status as a tropical storm was confirmed it was renamed tropical storm douglas at the time the agreement through the world meteorological organization was for storms to be renamed if they cross from the atlantic to the pacific 6 as the storm moved westward it quickly intensified with an eye-like feature developing by 0900 utc on july 29.[7 shortly thereafter douglas attained hurricane status about 115 mi 185 km southwest of the guatemala mexico border 6 around that time tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated two scenarios for the future of douglas one was a northwest track to make landfall near acapulco and the other was a continued west-northwest track while remaining offshore 8 hurricane douglas ultimately took the latter track 6 by late on july 29 the eye of the hurricane was well-defined on mexican radar and with favorable upper-level outflow warm sea surface temperatures and a climatologically favorable region for intense hurricanes the nhc forecast douglas to strengthen to winds of 115 mph 185 km h 9 the next day its structure became atypical of a strengthening hurricane and the eye was briefly not seen on satellite imagery 10 on july 31 douglas became much better organized as it turned more west-northwestward 11 and it attained major hurricane status or a category 3 on the saffirsimpson scale about 205 miles 330 km southwest of manzanillo by early on august 1 douglas reached peak winds of 130 mph 215 km h a category 4 on the saffirsimpson scale later that day the hurricane attained its lowest pressure of 946 mbar about 275 miles 440 km south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula douglas maintained peak intensity for 36 hours 6 until august 2 when the eye became less-organized as the overall convection began to weaken 12 weakening continued due to cooler waters as douglas turned to the west and on august 3 the hurricane deteriorated to tropical storm status 6 as a tropical storm there was minimal deep convection although the center remained very well-defined 13 on august 5 douglas weakened to tropical depression status and by the next day could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone the remnant circulation continued westward for several days 6 preparations prior to cesar's arrival in venezuela a tropical storm warning was issued for areas west of la vela de coro to the border with colombia the warning was discontinued later that day 1 the government of colombia issued a tropical storm warning on july 25 from the border with venezuela to barranquilla as well as the islands of aruba and curaao these warnings were discontinued later that day after the storm's passage 1 as cesar approached central america hurricane warnings were posted in nicaragua 31 hours before landfall leaving ample time to prepare for the hurricane with hurricane joan occurring only 8 years prior 10,724 people were evacuated before and during the hurricane to take refuge at special camps 14 on july 29 shortly after cesar emerged into the pacific ocean and was reclassified tropical depression seven-e the government of mexico issued a tropical storm watch from puerto madero to acapulco 5 about 12 hours later after the depression intensified into tropical storm douglas the mexican government canceled the watch and issued a new tropical storm warning from salina cruz to acapulco this was due to the large extent of tropical storm force winds associated with douglas and its proximity to the south coast of mexico another tropical storm watch was briefly issued on july 30 from acapulco to manzanillo 6 impact hurricane cesar was a moisture-laden tropical cyclone that dropped heavy rains along its path through the southern caribbean sea and central america damage was moderate to extreme due to mudslides and flooding and at least 113 people were killed lesser antilles and south america the precursor tropical wave to cesar produced rains and gusty winds through a large portion of the lesser antilles 1 in venezuela heavy rains from the storm triggered flooding and landslides that killed at least five people 22 in the capital city of caracas 45 people were left homeless as a result of the storm 23 although the storm passed directly over the region the abc islands off the coast of colombia and venezuela received little rainfall peaking at 0.15 in 3.8 mm on curaao peak gusts were also measured at 60 mph 95 km h on the island 1 the winds caused minor damage to roofs and trees across all three islands as well as rough surf that drowned one person in curaao 18 as a tropical storm cesar struck the northern coastline of colombia bringing heavy rains and gusty winds at least three people were killed in storm related incidents 15 two of which occurred when an avalanche buried a house in pueblo bello in the northern part of the country 24 cesar brought torrential rains to the archipelago of san andrs providencia and santa catalina offshore eastern nicaragua eleven people were killed across the archipelago including eight children who died in a landslide 16 across the islands 60 homes lost their roofs and numerous trees were felled due to high winds the local governor stated that losses from cesar reached 800 million cop 440,00 usd 17 nicaragua torrential rainfall was the immediate effect of cesar peaking at 10.7 inches 271 mm at bluefields nicaragua with many other locations reporting over 6 inches 150 mm the intense precipitation led to widespread mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country the most affected region was lake managua where the water level was approaching dangerous levels 25 the storm wrought extensive damage throughout the country leaving roughly 50.5 million in damage behind large portions of the country's crops were affected resulting in a food shortage following the hurricane according to nicaraguan officials more than 2,500 homes 39 bridges and 40 km 25 mi of road were destroyed by cesar in all the storm killed 42 people and left an estimated 100,000 homeless 26 costa rica like nicaragua costa rica received heavy rainfall from cesar leading to mudslides and widespread flooding river flooding damaged 51 houses and washed away 213 more 72 bridges were also destroyed the road network was significantly damaged 27 costa rica requested international aid subsequent to the storm across the country at least 39 people were killed and damage amounted to 151 million additionally 29 people were listed as missing 19 el salvador as cesar continued westward it produced heavy flooding and mudslides in western el salvador killing 9 in the community of jos cecilio del valle four others drowned in other parts of the country 27 mexico hurricane douglas brought up to 6 inches 150 mm of rain on the south coast of mexico and resulted in a 4 foot 1.2 m storm surge but no deaths were reported 28 aftermath see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names the name cesar was retired in spring of 1997 and will not be used again in the atlantic basin it was replaced with cristobal in the 2002 season because it caused no major effects on land the name douglas was not retired it was reused in the 2002 2008 and the
