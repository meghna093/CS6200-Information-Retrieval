vaporliquid equilibrium  wikipediain thermodynamics and chemical engineering the vaporliquid equilibrium vle describes the distribution of a chemical species between the gas phase and a liquid phase the concentration of a vapor in contact with its liquid especially at equilibrium is often expressed in terms of vapor pressure which will be a partial pressure a part of the total gas pressure if any other gas es are present with the vapor the equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid is in general strongly dependent on temperature at vaporliquid equilibrium a liquid with individual components in certain concentrations will have an equilibrium vapor in which the concentrations or partial pressures of the vapor components have certain values depending on all of the liquid component concentrations and the temperature the converse is also true if a vapor with components at certain concentrations or partial pressures is in vaporliquid equilibrium with its liquid then the component concentrations in the liquid will be determined dependent on the vapor concentrations and on the temperature the equilibrium concentration of each component in the liquid phase is often different from its concentration or vapor pressure in the vapor phase but there is a relationship the vle concentration data can be determined experimentally or computed or approximated with the help of theories such as raoult's law dalton's law and henry's law such vaporliquid equilibrium information is useful in designing columns for distillation especially fractional distillation which is a particular specialty of chemical engineers 1]  [2 defined by where yi and xi are the mole fractions of component i in the phases y and x respectively for raoult's law for modified raoult's law where is the activity coefficient pi is the partial pressure and p is the pressure the values of the ratio ki are correlated empirically or theoretically in terms of temperature pressure and phase compositions in the form of equations tables or graph such as the depriester charts shown on the right 7 k-values for systems of light hydrocarbons low temperature range k-values for systems of light hydrocarbons high temperature range for binary mixtures the ratio of the k values for the two components is called the relative volatility denoted by  which is a measure of the relative ease or difficulty of separating the two components large-scale industrial distillation is rarely undertaken if the relative volatility is less than 1.05 with the volatile component being i and the less volatile component being j 2 k values are widely used in the design calculations of continuous distillation columns for distilling multicomponent mixtures vaporliquid equilibrium diagrams vapor-liquid equilibrium diagram for each component in a binary mixture one could make a vaporliquid equilibrium diagram such a diagram would graph liquid mole fraction on a horizontal axis and vapor mole fraction on a vertical axis in such vle diagrams liquid mole fractions for components 1 and 2 can be represented as x1 and x2 respectively and vapor mole fractions of the corresponding components are commonly represented as y1 and y2.[2 similarly for binary mixtures in these vle diagrams such vle diagrams are square with a diagonal line running from the x1  0 y1  0 corner to the x1  1 y1  1 corner for reference these types of vle diagrams are used in the mccabethiele method to determine the number of equilibrium stages or theoretical plates needed to distill a given composition binary feed mixture into one distillate fraction and one bottoms fraction corrections can also be made to take into account the incomplete efficiency of each tray in a distillation column when compared to a theoretical plate raoult's law main article raoult's law at boiling and higher temperatures the sum of the individual component partial pressures becomes equal to the overall pressure which can symbolized as ptot under such conditions dalton's law would be in effect as follows then for each component in the vapor phase where p1  partial pressure of component 1 p2  partial pressure of component 2 etc raoult's law is approximately valid for mixtures of components between which there is very little interaction other than the effect of dilution by the other components examples of such mixtures includes mixtures of alkanes which are non-polar relatively inert compounds in many ways so there is little attraction or repulsion between the molecules raoult's law states that for components 1 2 etc in a mixture where p o1 p o2 etc are the vapor pressures of components 1 2 etc when they are pure and x1 x2 etc are mole fractions of the corresponding component in the liquid recall from the first section that vapor pressures of liquids are very dependent on temperature thus the po pure vapor pressures for each component are a function of temperature t for example commonly for a pure liquid component the clausiusclapeyron relation may be used to approximate how the vapor pressure varies as a function of temperature this makes each of the partial pressures dependent on temperature also regardless of whether raoult's law applies or not when raoult's law is valid these expressions become at boiling temperatures if raoult's law applies the total pressure becomes at a given ptot such as 1 atm and a given liquid composition t can be solved for to give the liquid mixture's boiling point or bubble point although the solution for t may not be mathematically analytical i e may require a numerical solution or approximation for a binary mixture at a given ptot the bubble point t can become a function of x1 or x2 and this function can be shown on a two-dimensional graph like a binary boiling point diagram at boiling temperatures if raoult's law applies a number of the preceding equations in this section can be combined to give the following expressions for vapor mole fractions as a function of liquid mole fractions and temperature once the bubble point t's as a function of liquid composition in terms of mole fractions have been determined these values can be inserted into the above equations to obtain corresponding vapor compositions in terms of mole fractions when this is finished over a complete range of liquid mole fractions and their corresponding temperatures one effectively obtains a temperature t function of vapor composition mole fractions this function effectively acts as the dew point t function of vapor composition in the case of a binary mixture x2  1  x1 and the above equations can be expressed as for many kinds of mixtures particularly where there is interaction between components beyond simply the effects of dilution raoult's law does not work well for determining the shapes of the curves in the boiling point or vle diagrams even in such mixtures there are usually still differences in the vapor and liquid equilibrium concentrations at most points and distillation is often still useful for separating components at least partially for such mixtures empirical data is typically used in determining such boiling point and vle diagrams chemical engineers have done a significant amount of research trying to develop equations for correlating and or predicting vle data for various kinds of mixtures which do not obey raoult's law well
