expedition 1  wikipedia iss expedition 1 the iss during expedition 1 seen during the approach of sts-97 the first shuttle mission to visit the inhabited space station mission type iss expedition mission duration 136 days 17 hours 9 minutes docking to hatch closing                 [36 on 23 january 2001 the crew photographed a plume of volcanic ash from popocatpetl volcano mexico like previous missions the astronauts took many photos of earth from the station over 700 in total which have been made freely available nasa 30 these crew earth observations are intended to record dynamic events on the earth's surface such as storms fires or volcanoes nasa 31 for example a photo from 1 january 2001 shows mount cleveland alaska with a plume of smoke prior to its eruption the following month nasa 32 on 23 january 2001 the crew observed a unique perspective of a plume of volcanic ash coming from popocatpetl an active volcano 70 kilometres southeast of mexico city nasa 33 an example of a low-maintenance experiment was the protein crystal growth experiment which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions nasa 34 the goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the earth and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during expedition 1 only four resulted in successful crystallizations which was a lower success rate than predicted nasa 34 of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener thaumatin whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than earth-grown crystal which resulted in a more accurate protein structure model nasa 34 another research activity was measuring the crew's heart rates and the station's carbon dioxide levels to determine the effect of exercise on the station nasa 12 imax filming throughout the mission the expedition 1 crew filmed footage for use in the imax documentary film space station 3d 37 highlights of the footage include the first entry into the destiny module during sts-98 the expedition 1 crew showering and shaving in zero gravity and the docking of sts-102 followed by the change over to the expedition 2 crew 37 references
