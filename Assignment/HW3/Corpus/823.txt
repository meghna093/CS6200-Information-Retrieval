atlantic hurricane season hurricane bob was one of the costliest hurricanes in new england history the second named storm and first hurricane of the 1991 atlantic hurricane season bob developed from an area of low pressure near the bahamas on august 16 the depression steadily intensified and became tropical storm bob late on august 16 bob curved north-northwestward as a tropical storm but re-curved to the north-northeast after becoming a hurricane on august 17 as such it brushed the outer banks of north carolina on august 18 and august 19 and subsequently intensified into a major hurricane category 3 or greater on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale after peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph 185 km h bob weakened slightly as it approached the coast of new england bob made landfall twice in rhode island as a category 2 hurricane on august 19 first on block island and then in newport upon doing so it became the only hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous united states during the 1991 season moving further inland bob rapidly weakened and deteriorated to a tropical storm while emerging into the gulf of maine shortly thereafter bob made landfall in maine as a strong tropical storm early on august 20 bob entered the canadian province of new brunswick a few hours later where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by august 21 the remnants of bob crossed newfoundland and re-emerged into the open atlantic ocean the remnants traveled a long distance across the northern atlantic ocean and finally dissipated west of portugal on august 29 bob left extensive damage throughout new england in its wake totaling approximately 1.5 billion 1991 usd 2.64 billion 2017 usd this made it one of the costliest united states hurricanes at the time as of 2013 it ranked thirty-second in the category in addition seventeen fatalities were reported in association with bob the loss of life and most of the damage occurred as a result of high winds and rough seas there were six confirmed tornadoes during its passage bob is the most recent hurricane to hit the new england states directly as a hurricane 1 meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale hurricane bob originated from the remnants of a frontal trough to the southeast of bermuda on august 12 the system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the bahamas by august 15th satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a couple hundred miles east of the bahamas 2 operationally the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600 utc on august 16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 37 mph 60 km h 3 after post-storm analysis it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around 0000 utc several hours after being designated the system began to develop convective banding features roughly 18 hours after being declared a depression the national hurricane center nhc upgraded it to a tropical storm giving it the name bob at this time bob was situated roughly 140 mi 225 km northeast of nassau bahamas the storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the deep layer mean flow it was embedded within 2 a deepening trough over the eastern united states was forecast to turn the storm toward the north on august 16 this turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated 4 the storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced from the center of circulation however upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the gulf stream 5 later that day bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719 utc following this reading the nhc upgraded the storm to a category 1 hurricane on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale 2 shortly after the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the atlantic and the trough over the southeastern united states 6 by august 18 the nhc noted that the hurricane was asymmetrical having uneven distribution of the wind radii 7 later that day deep convection continued to form and an eye later appeared on satellite imagery early the next day the eye became increasingly defined as the center of bob passed roughly 35 mi 55 km from the north carolina coastline by 0600 utc hurricane hunters recorded flight level winds of 140 mph 225 km h corresponding to surface winds of 115 mph 185 km h at this time the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to 950 mbar hpa 28.05 inhg the lowest pressure recorded during the storm after attaining this intensity the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at 25 mph 35 km h steered by the trough over the southeast united states an upper-level cutoff low over the great lakes region and the subtropical ridge over the atlantic 6 the track of hurricane bob by august 19 was similar to that of hurricane carol in 1954 another major hurricane that impacted new england 6 significantly cooler sea surface temperatures in the path of the hurricane resulted in weakening leading to the eye becoming cloud-filled later on august 19 the western portion of the eyewall brushed the eastern tip of long island around 1800 utc the center of bob made landfall near newport rhode island with winds of 100 mph 155 km h making it a category 2 hurricane the storm quickly weakened as it tracked through rhode island and massachusetts before entering the gulf of maine around 0130 utc on august 20 the now weakened tropical storm bob made another landfall near rockport maine with winds of 70 mph 110 km h 6 later that day bob had crossed through maine and part of new brunswick canada and entered the gulf of st lawrence around 1800 utc the former hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early the next day the storm passed over northern newfoundland before re-entering the atlantic ocean rapidly tracking eastward the storm briefly weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression on august 22 after restrengthening to tropical storm-force winds the remnants of bob turned towards the southeast and slowed once more the extratropical system weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression however it did not re-intensify the storm slowly tracked towards the east before dissipating off the coast of portugal on august 29.  [46 and there were five other deaths across the state 23 the most significant area affected by bob was massachusetts where over 1 billion in damage occurred 47 a c-man station in buzzards bay recorded

electric company brought electricians from outside the company and put their own workers on 16hour shifts to restore power across massachusetts 43 most massachusetts residents excluding those living

new england coast was affected by a powerful nor'easter known as the perfect storm about two months after the hurricane struck the region some locations experienced worse damage from the october storm than from bob 64 due to the high damage from hurricane bob president george h w bush declared the following states as disaster in order rhode island massachusetts maine connecticut new hampshire and new york 65 damage in maine was insufficient to qualify for individual family assistance 56 instead the declaration allocated federal funding to reimburse cities for debris removal repairing damaged public buildings and other municipal expenses for each of the states despite the declaration the federal government did not immediately provide aid to the affected region this was partially due to president bush considering the storm a disaster but not an emergency which therefore required cuts from other budgets to offset the relief aid this was in opposition to the democratic-controlled congress who requested an expedited process 66 the name bob was subsequently retired by the world meteorological organization's hurricane committee and will never be used again for an atlantic hurricane 67 see also tropical cyclones portal list of atlantic hurricanes list of new england hurricanes list of retired atlantic hurricane names list of wettest tropical cyclones in massachusetts
