drought  wikipediafor other uses see drought disambiguation a drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply whether atmospheric surface water or ground water a drought can last for months or years or may be declared after as few as 15 days 1 it can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region             [70 by far the largest part of australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback a 2005 study by australian and american researchers investigated the desertification of the interior and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior australia 71 in june 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term maybe irreversible severe ecological damage for the whole murray-darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by october 2008.[72 australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future a government-commissioned report said on july 6 2008.[73 australian environmentalist tim flannery predicted that unless it made drastic changes perth in western australia could become the worlds first ghost metropolis an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population 74 the long australian millennial drought broke in 2010 recurring droughts leading to desertification in east africa have created grave ecological catastrophes prompting food shortages in 198485 2006 and 2011.[75 during the 2011 drought an estimated 50,000 to 150,000 people were reported to have died 76 though these figures and the extent of the crisis are disputed 77 in february 2012 the un announced that the crisis was over due to a scaling up of relief efforts and a bumper harvest 78 aid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery efforts including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds 78 in 2012 a severe drought struck the western sahel the methodist relief  development fund mrdf reported that more than 10 million people in the region were at risk of famine due to a month-long heat wave that was hovering over niger mali mauritania and burkina faso a fund of about 20,000 was distributed to the drought-hit countries 79 protection mitigation and relief succulent plants are well-adapted to survive long periods of drought water distribution on marshall islands during el nio agriculturally people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation failure to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era exacerbated by ever-increasing population densities president roosevelt on april 27 1935 signed documents creating the soil conservation service scs now the natural resources conservation service nrcs models of the law were sent to each state where they were enacted these were the first enduring practical programs to curtail future susceptibility to drought creating agencies that first began to stress soil conservation measures to protect farm lands today it was not until the 1950s that there was an importance placed on water conservation was put into the existing laws nrcs 2014 80 aerosols over the amazon each september for four burning seasons 2005 through 2008 during the amazon basin drought the aerosol scale yellow to dark reddish-brown indicates the relative amount of particles that absorb sunlight strategies for drought protection mitigation or relief include dams  many dams and their associated reservoirs supply additional water in times of drought 81 cloud seeding  a form of intentional weather modification to induce rainfall 82 this remains a hotly debated topic as the united states national research council released a report in 2004 stating that to date there is still no convincing scientific proof of the efficacy of intentional weather modification 83 desalination  of sea water for irrigation or consumption 84 drought monitoring  continuous observation of rainfall levels and comparisons with current usage levels can help prevent man-made drought for instance analysis of water usage in yemen has revealed that their water table underground water level is put at grave risk by over-use to fertilize their khat crop 85 careful monitoring of moisture levels can also help predict increased risk for wildfires using such metrics as the keetch-byram drought index[49 or palmer drought index land use  carefully planned crop rotation can help to minimize erosion and allow farmers to plant less water-dependent crops in drier years outdoor water-use restriction  regulating the use of sprinklers hoses or buckets on outdoor plants filling pools and other water-intensive home maintenance tasks xeriscaping yards can significantly reduce unnecessary water use by residents of towns and cities rainwater harvesting  collection and storage of rainwater from roofs or other suitable catchments recycled water  former wastewater sewage that has been treated and purified for reuse transvasement  building canals or redirecting rivers as massive attempts at irrigation in drought-prone areas see also aridity index collapse how societies choose to fail or succeed
