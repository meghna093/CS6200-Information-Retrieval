100-year flood  wikipediafor other uses see 100-year flood disambiguation a one-hundred-year flood is a flood event that has a 1 probability of occurring in any given year the 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1 flood since its annual exceedance probability is 1 1 for river systems the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate the flood water level can be mapped as an area of inundation the resulting floodplain map is referred to as the 100-year floodplain estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the united states are available 2 in the uk the environment agency publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood 3 areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of tide storm surge and waves 4 maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits environmental regulations and flood insurance probability a common misunderstanding exists that a 100-year flood is likely to occur only once in a 100-year period in fact there is approximately a 63.4 chance of one or more 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period on the danube river at passau germany the actual intervals between 100-year floods during 1501 to 2013 ranged from 37 to 192 years 5 the probability pe that one or more floods occurring during any period will exceed a given flood threshold can be expressed using the binomial distribution as where t is the threshold return period e g 100-yr 50-yr 25-yr and so forth and n is the number of years in the period the probability of exceedance pe is also described as the natural inherent or hydrologic risk of failure 6]  :24 for the largest recorded flood at any specific location or any potentially larger event the recurrence interval always is poorly known 5]:20,24 spatial variability adds more uncertainty because a flood peak observed at different locations on the same stream during the same event commonly represents a different recurrence interval at each location 5]:20 if an extreme storm drops enough rain on one branch of a river to cause a 100-year flood but no rain falls over another branch the flood wave downstream from their junction might have a recurrence interval of only 10 years conversely a storm that produces a 25-year flood simultaneously in each branch might form a 100-year flood downstream during a time of flooding news accounts necessarily simplify the story by reporting the greatest damage and largest recurrence interval estimated at any location the public can easily and incorrectly conclude that the recurrence interval applies to all stream reaches in the flood area 5]:7,24 observed intervals between floods peak elevations of 14 floods as early as 1501 on the danube river at passau germany reveal great variability in the actual intervals between floods 5]:1619 flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501 and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood only half of the intervals between 50 and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of the nominal average interval similarly the intervals between 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years and only half were within 2.5 to 7.5 years observed intervals between floods at passau 1501-2013 regulatory use in the united states the 100-year flood provides the risk basis for flood insurance rates complete information on the national flood insurance program nfip is available here a regulatory flood or base flood is routinely established for river reaches through a science-based rule-making process targeted to a 100-year flood at the historical average recurrence interval in addition to historical flood data the process accounts for previously established regulatory values the effects of flood-control reservoirs and changes in land use in the watershed coastal flood hazards have been mapped by a similar approach that includes the relevant physical processes most areas where serious floods can occur in the united states have been mapped consistently in this manner on average nationwide those 100-year flood estimates are well sufficient for the purposes of the nfip and offer reasonable estimates of future flood risk if the future is like the past 5]:24 approximately 3 of the u s population lives in areas subject to the 1 annual chance coastal flood hazard 13 see also extreme weather flood forecasting frequency of exceedance list of floods lists of floods in the united states references external links what is a 100 year flood boulder area sustainability information network basin url accessed 2006-06-16
