[10 sculptor galaxy 10 and messier 83.[11 five planets can be recognized as planets from earth with the naked eye mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn under typical dark sky conditions uranus magnitude 5.8 can be seen as well with averted vision the sun and the moonthe remaining noticeable naked-eye objects of the solar systemare sometimes added to make seven planets  during daylight only the moon and sun are obvious naked eye objects but in many cases venus can be spotted in daylight and in rarer cases jupiter close to sunset and sunrise bright stars like sirius or even canopus can be spotted with the naked eye as long as one knows the exact position in which to look historically the zenith of naked-eye astronomy was the work of tycho brahe 15461601 he built an extensive observatory to make precise measurements of the heavens without any instruments for magnification in 1610 galileo galilei pointed a telescope towards the sky he immediately discovered the moons of jupiter and the phases of venus among other things meteor showers are better observed by naked eye than with binoculars such showers include the perseids 1012 august and the december geminids some 100 satellites per night the international space station and the milky way are other popular objects visible to the naked eye 12 space geodesy and navigation many other things can be estimated without an instrument if an arm is stretched the span of the hand corresponds to an angle of 18 to 20 the distance of a person just covered up by the outstretched thumbnail is about 100 meters the vertical can be estimated to about 2 and in the northern hemisphere observing the pole star and using a protractor can give the observer's geographic latitude up to 1 degree of accuracy the babylonians mayans ancient egyptians ancient indians and chinese measured all the basics of their respective time and calendar systems by naked eye the length of a year and a month to 0.1 hour or to better than 1 minute 0.001 the 24 hours of a day and the equinoxes the periods of the planets were calculated by mayan astronomers to within 5 to 10 minutes accuracy in the case of venus and mars in a similar manner star occultations by the moon can be observed by using a digital clock an accuracy of 0.2 second is possible this represents only 200 meters at the moon's distance of 385,000 km small objects and maps observing a nearby small object without a magnifying glass or a microscope the size of the object depends on the viewing distance under normal lighting conditions light source  1000 lumens at height 600700 mm viewing angle  35 degrees the angular size recognized by naked eye will be round 1 arc minute  1 60 degrees  0.0003 radians 1 at a viewing distance of 16   400 mm which is considered a normal reading distance in the usa the smallest object resolution will be  0.116 mm for inspection purposes laboratories use a viewing distance of 200250 mm citation needed which gives the smallest size of the object recognizable to the naked eye of 0.058 0.072 mm ~55-75 micrometers the accuracy of a measurement ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 mm and depends on the experience of the observer the latter figure is the usual positional accuracy of faint details in maps and technical plans environmental pollution the milky way is visible over the very large telescope demonstrating clear atmosphere above paranal observatory 13 a clean atmosphere is indicated by the fact that the milky way is visible comparing the zenith with the horizon shows how the blue quality is degraded depending on the amount of air pollution and dust the twinkling of a star is an indication of the turbulence of the air this is of importance in meteorology and for the seeing of astronomy light pollution is a significant problem for amateur astronomers but becomes less late at night when many lights are shut off air dust can be seen even far away from a city by its light dome literature davidson n sky phenomena a
