low-pressure area  wikipedia this low-pressure system over iceland spins counter-clockwise due to balance between the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force weather system redirects here for a general discussion on pressure areas see pressure system a low-pressure area low or depression is a region on the topographic map where the atmospheric pressure is lower than that of surrounding locations low-pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence that occur in the upper levels of the troposphere the formation process of a low-pressure area is known as cyclogenesis within the field of meteorology atmospheric divergence aloft occurs in two areas the first area is on the east side of upper troughs which form half of a rossby wave within the westerlies a trough with large wavelength that extends through the troposphere a second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of embedded shortwave troughs which are of smaller wavelength diverging winds aloft ahead of these troughs cause atmospheric lift within the troposphere below which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity thermal lows form due to localized heating caused by greater sunshine over deserts and other land masses since localized areas of warm air are less dense than their surroundings this warmer air rises which lowers atmospheric pressure near that portion of the earth's surface large-scale thermal lows over continents help drive monsoon circulations low-pressure areas can also form due to organized thunderstorm activity over warm water when this occurs over the tropics in concert with the intertropical convergence zone it is known as a monsoon trough monsoon troughs reach their northerly extent in august and their southerly extent in february when a convective low acquires a well-hot circulation in the tropics it is termed a tropical cyclone tropical cyclones can form during any month of the year globally but can occur in either the northern or southern hemisphere during november atmospheric lift will also generally produce cloud cover through adiabatic cooling once the air becomes saturated as it rises although the low-pressure area typically brings cloudy skies which act to minimize diurnal temperature extremes since clouds reflect sunlight incoming shortwave solar radiation decreases which causes lower temperatures during the day at night the absorptive effect of clouds on outgoing longwave radiation such as heat energy from the surface allows for warmer diurnal low temperatures in all seasons the stronger the area of low pressure the stronger the winds experienced in its vicinity globally low-pressure systems are most frequently located over the tibetan plateau and in the lee of the rocky mountains in europe particularly in the united kingdom recurring low-pressure weather systems are typically known as depressions formation main article cyclogenesis cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of cyclonic circulations or low-pressure areas within the atmosphere 1 cyclogenesis is the opposite of cyclolysis and has an anticyclonic high-pressure system equivalent which deals with the formation of high-pressure areasanticyclogenesis 2 cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes all of which result in the development of some sort of cyclone meteorologists use the term cyclone where circular pressure systems flow in the direction of the earth's rotation 3]       [50 see also east asian monsoon high-pressure area intertropical convergence zone north american monsoon surface weather analysis tropical wave trough meteorology weather map references v t e cyclones and anticyclones of the world centers of action types extratropical mesocyclone anticyclonic storm polar subtropical cyclone subtropical ridge thermal tropical anticyclones polar high siberian high azores high bermuda north atlantic north american high canadian greenland south atlantic high st helena north pacific high hawaii high south pacific high kalahari high cyclones aleutian low alaska far east russia atlantic hurricane australian low east coast european windstorm genoa low icelandic low kona storm hawaii mediterranean tropical-like cyclone nor'easter pacific hurricane polar vortex typhoon wake low v t e extratropical cyclones concepts extratropical cyclone storm cyclone low-pressure area weather bomb sting jet north america continental alberta clipper colorado low gulf low panhandle hook witch of november oceanic aleutian low nor'easter gulf low pacific northwest windstorm europe black sea storms european windstorm mediterranean tropical-like cyclone genoa low asia continental north asian storms east asian-northwest pacific storms other areas arctic australian east coast low kona storm southern ocean cyclone sudestada authority control gnd 4185417-2
