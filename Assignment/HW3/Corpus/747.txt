it is one of two tunnels that link the cities of norfolk and portsmouth it carries u s highway 58 and operated without tolls until february 1 2014 history the two-lane midtown tunnel was completed september 6 1962 supplementing the downtown tunnel and the berkley bridge it was the second fixed crossing directly between portsmouth and norfolk across the elizabeth river it was financed and built by the elizabeth river tunnel commission with toll revenue bonds in 1988 and 1989 during an expansion of i-264 the downtown tunnel and the berkley bridge were rebuilt and expanded tolls were also removed from the midtown and downtown tunnels at that time prior to 2007 the westbound lane of us route 58 right before the tunnel's entry had an hov lane that spanned a total of 25 yards until its removal during construction in 2007 this lane allowed hov traffic to merge in right at the tunnel entrance there is some speculation that this might have been the shortest hov lane in the united states and possibly the world issues congestion during its first year of operation 8,400 vehicles per day crossed through the tunnel as port traffic expanded between norfolk international terminals and portsmouth marine terminal during the 1980s tunnel volumes increased year over year reaching 40,000 vehicles per day in 2013 3 of which is at least a truck with one trailer as is typical of trucks leaving the port 1 as this number greatly exceeds its original capacity hours of congestion are both a routine and daily occurrence at the crossing 2 floodgate failure in september 2003 the midtown tunnel was flooded and seriously damaged by hurricane isabel the facility is equipped with floodgates designed for closure to protect it from flooding during extreme weather conditions such as east coast hurricanes as flood waters were rising during the storm workers were unable to remove plates that were both bolted and tack-welded to the roadbed as a result the flood gates could not be completely closed and the tunnel filled with an estimated 44 million gallons of water the tunnel suffered substantial electrical and mechanical damage but was not damaged structurally it was closed for nearly four weeks as water and sediment was pumped out systems inspected and essential repairs were completed 3 it was later determined that managers of the virginia department of transportation vdot had failed to adequately test the floodgates vdot revamped its operating procedures at all of its tunnels in the wake of the incident studies of additional harbor crossings have also gained additional attention since then expansion rehab and elizabeth river crossings history the need for expanded capacity at the midtown tunnel location has been well known and documented for decades but developing a successful funding strategy to expand the tunnel has remained elusive over time in 2006 the hampton roads metropolitan planning organization mpo undertook a study to determine the feasibility of utilizing toll financing to support the regions high priority unfunded transportation projects which included the midtown tunnel project this analysis concluded that the development and enhancements of the midtown tunnel and mlk freeway extension projects could be financially feasible if tolls were also collected to supplement inadequate public funds this would include tolling the parallel downtown tunnel to create a congestion management plan to prevent the diversion of potential midtown tunnel traffic to a competing free facility public private partnership after numerous studies and legislative attempts to fund the project publicly governor bob mcdonnell and vdot in 2011 contracted with elizabeth river crossings erc to build a new midtown tunnel rehabilitate the existing midtown tunnel as well as the downtown tunnels and extend the martin luther king freeway under the agreement vdot retained ownership and oversight of the tunnels however erc will finance build operate and maintain the facilities for a 58-year concession period erc will also assume risk of delivering the project on a performance-based fixed-price fixed-date contract protecting users and taxpayers from cost overruns and delays 4]  [11 after that rates will increase annually by a factor equal to the greater of changes to consumer price index or 3.5 percent 12 notes  peak hours are
