south pacific tropical cyclone  wikipediaa south pacific tropical cyclone is a non frontal low pressure system that has developed within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and little vertical wind shear aloft in the south pacific ocean 1 within the southern hemisphere there are officially three areas where tropical cyclones develop on a regular basis these areas are the south-west indian ocean between africa and 90e the australian region between 90e and 160e and the south pacific basin between 160e and 120w the south pacific basin between 160e and 120w is officially monitored by the fiji meteorological service and new zealand's metservice while others like the australian bureau of meteorology and the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration also monitor the basin each tropical cyclone year within this basin starts on july 1 and runs throughout the year encompassing the tropical cyclone season which runs from november 1 and lasts until april 30 each season within the basin most tropical cyclones have their origins within the south pacific convergence zone or within the northern australian monsoon trough both of which form an extensive area of cloudiness and are dominant features of the season within this region a tropical disturbance is classified as a tropical cyclone when it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65 km h 35 mph that wrap halfway around the low level circulation centre while a severe tropical cyclone is classified when the maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds are greater than 120 km h 75 mph basin history the ancient mariners of the south seas who roamed the tropical pacific before the arrival of the europeans knew of and feared the hurricanes of the south pacific 2 they were keen and accurate observers of nature with traditional myths and legends reflecting their knowledge of these systems 2 on his voyages around the pacific it is thought that captain james cook did not collect any information about cyclones in the pacific 2 the european whalers traders and missionaries that followed cook soon realised that the south pacific was not free of hurricanes and were the first to publish accounts about the systems 2 during 1853 thomas dobson subsequently became the first person to collect information about these systems in order to attempt to understand and explain the characteristics of 24 tropical cyclones 2 however these descriptions were vague and of little value because he only had a small amount of data and no synoptic weather charts 2 over the next 40 years various reports journals and log books on the storms were published before e knipping consolidated these reports and extended dobson's list out to 120 tropical cyclones during 1893.
