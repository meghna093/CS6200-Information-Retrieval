east coast of the united states central canada part of the 1954 atlantic hurricane season hurricane hazel was the deadliest and costliest hurricane of the 1954 atlantic hurricane season the storm killed at least 400 people in haiti before striking the united states near the border between north and south carolina as a category 4 hurricane after causing 95 fatalities in the us hazel struck canada as an extratropical storm raising the death toll by 81 people mostly in toronto as a result of the high death toll and the damage caused by hazel its name was retired from use for north atlantic hurricanes in haiti hazel destroyed 40 of the coffee trees and 50 of the cacao crop affecting the economy for several years to come the hurricane made landfall near calabash north carolina and destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of impact from north carolina it traveled north along the atlantic coast hazel affected virginia washington d c west virginia maryland delaware new jersey pennsylvania and new york it brought gusts near 160 km h 100 mph and caused 281 million 1954 usd in damage when it was over pennsylvania hazel consolidated with a cold front and turned northwest towards canada when it hit ontario as an extratropical storm rivers and streams in and around toronto overflowed their banks which caused severe flooding as a result many residential areas located in the local floodplains such as the raymore drive area were subsequently converted to parkland in canada alone over c 135 million 2016 1.2 billion of damage was incurred the effects of hazel were particularly unprecedented in toronto due to a combination of heavy rainfall during the preceding weeks a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm's unexpected retention of power hazel had traveled 1,100 km 680 mi over land but while approaching canada it had merged with an existing powerful cold front the storm stalled over the greater toronto area and although it was now extratropical it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane to help with the cleanup 800 members of the military were summoned and a hurricane relief fund was established that distributed 5.1 million 2009 41.7 million in aid meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale on october 5 a tropical wave with tropical-storm force winds was approaching the lesser antilles due to the potential for tropical storm formation a hurricane hunters plane flew from san juan puerto rico to investigate the system 1 when the plane reached the system they observed a tropical cyclone about 30 mi 50 km east of the island of grenada with winds estimated at 100 mph 160 km h the united states weather bureau promptly classified the system as hurricane hazel 2 the atlantic hurricane reanalysis later assessed that hazel developed at 06:00 utc on october 5 about 220 mi 350 km east of grenada although the hurricane hunters observed hurricane-force winds the storm had a small eye 5 mi 8 km in diameter and a central barometric pressure of 1,002 mbar 29.6 inhg the 100 mph 160 km h winds were therefore revised downward to 65 mph 100 km h late on october 5 though it was estimated that the storm attained hurricane status at 00:00 utc on october 6 at the same time hazel made landfall on grenada with winds of 75 mph 120 km h 3 after entering the caribbean sea hazel continued to present a small eye and wind diameter the winds gradually increased as the storm moved westward parallel to the northern venezuela coast on october 8 the tiny eye increased to a diameter of 29 mi 46 km while the winds reached 85 mph 135 km h 3 although winds were estimated as high as 125 mph 201 km h that day the hurricane hunters encountered severe turbulence which hospitalized one crew member and injured another 4 for the next five days there were no further flights into the core of the hurricane although the planes continued to monitor the storm with radar imagery indicating that the eye became open and ragged late on october 9 it is estimated hazel intensified into a major hurricane with winds of 115 mph 185 km h originally it was estimated that hazel attained these winds the day prior the intensification was confirmed on october 10 when aircraft noted a well-defined eye on radar imagery 3 on october 10 hazel slowed in the central caribbean and turned sharply to the north-northeast toward hispaniola 3 steered by an upper-level low 5 at 09:00 utc on october 12 the hurricane made landfall near chardonnires along the tiburon peninsula of haiti as a category 3 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale there were no strong wind readings at landfall but based on previous radar and aircraft observations the sustained winds were officially estimated at 120 mph 195 km h after moving through the gulf of gonve hazel struck northwestern haiti near baie-de-henne at 00:00 utc on october 13 as a category 2 hurricane with winds estimated at 100 mph 160 km h 3 around that time the hurricane curved more to the north and northwest due to an approaching trough 6 and the hurricane hunters resumed entering the center of hazel reporting an eye and hurricane force winds at 14:00 utc on october 13 hazel struck inagua in the bahamas with winds of 100 mph 160 km h 3 after affecting the bahamas hazel accelerated northwest toward the southeastern united states 3 steered between a trough and a ridge 6 hurricanes are generally expected to lose power after going north of florida due to lower water temperatures however hazel restrengthened as it tracked northward over the gulf stream 7 the hurricane hunters were unable to observe the core of the storm until it neared land reporting an eye 18 mi 33 km in diameter on october 15 later that day a ship just offshore south carolina reported a central pressure of 938 mbar 27.7 inhg which was the lowest in association with the hurricane at 15:30 utc on october 15 hazel made landfall just west of the north carolina south carolina border with a 40 mi 64 km eye slightly northeast of myrtle beach in the latter state based on the pressure a larger than average size and the fast forward movement the landfall intensity was estimated at 130 mph 215 km h or a category 4 on the saffir-simpson scale 3 the eye of hazel was tracked across several towns in north carolina as the system continued northward at 18:00 utc on october 15 the hurricane became extratropical near raleigh and within six hours had passed near washington d c the extratropical remnants of hazel accelerated to the north through pennsylvania and new york along an extended cold front despite widespread observations across the eastern united states there was uncertainty in the track of hazel as an extratropical storm although it was possible the original circulation dissipated over western pennsylvania and a new one formed over western new york the atlantic hurricane reanalysis assessed the circulation as becoming elongated but continuous on october 16 the storm crossed into ontario and over the toronto region 3 shortly thereafter the former hurricane hazel dropped to gale-force winds after moving almost 1,000 km 620 mi over land 3]       [43 floodwaters slowly rose in holland marsh  a bowl-shaped valley near bradford  allowing people to escape to the town 44 highway 400 which passes through the marsh was under as much as 10 ft 3 m of water in some places when as much 6 m 20 ft of water backed up much of the crops in the area were either swept away or ruined 45 after the water pumps failed due to debris better equipment allowed the holland marsh to be drained by november 13.[46 the humber river in the west end of toronto caused the most destruction as a result of an intense flash flood after most minor rivers and creeks drained into it 47 a team of five volunteer firefighters were killed when their fire truck was swept away as they were responding to help a stranded motorist 48 communities in the humber floodplain were devastated at woodbridge the river swelled from its usual width of 20 m 66 ft at its narrowest point to 107 m 351 ft and left hundreds homeless and nine dead the humber swept away 366 m 1,201 ft of raymore drive and 14 nearby homes killing 35 people out of the 81 canadian fatalities the rise of the river was unprecedented and the residents did not evacuate which led to the high death toll 47 the etobicoke creek also overflowed its banks at the village of long branch killing seven people after many dwellings were swept into lake ontario 49 the death toll of 81 people has not since been equaled by a natural disaster in canada in addition to the casualties over 4,000 families were left homeless 50 the department of public safety and emergency preparedness canada estimates the total cost of hurricane hazel for canada taking into account long-term effects such as economic disruption the cost of lost property and recovery costs to be c 137,552,400.[51 aftermath haiti in the aftermath of hazel a three-day period of national mourning was declared in haiti for hurricane victims with existing infrastructure already poor the recovery was very slow since many of the few existing roads were blocked and communications equipment was either out damaged or destroyed the haitian red cross appealed for assistance to the international red cross while the american red cross made a donation of 25,000 1954 usd pan american world airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid 52 and the us aircraft carrier uss saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies 53 despite the relief effort there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following hazel due to a lack of clean water 54 united states in the carolinas the national guard was mobilised by the evening of october 15 to prevent looting along affected areas of the coastline on october 17 president dwight d eisenhower declared a major disaster in the carolinas and offered immediate and unlimited federal assistance 55 recovery was quick and by october 24 all but two units were demobilised another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts an artificial sand dune barrier 39 km 24 mi long was completed by october 30 which in the long run led to a more rapid natural build-up of larger dunes with myrtle beach a popular tourist destination the chamber of commerce began an information campaign to inform the public which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed that the city would be ready for the coming summer the rebuilding after the partial destruction would transform myrtle beach from a quaint summer colony to a high-rise resort city 56 canada main article effects of hurricane hazel in canada a weir was built on the humber river near raymore drive to lessen the risk of a similar catastrophic flood the army sent about 800 soldiers to toronto to assist with the cleanup providing blankets and mattresses toronto residents helped out with the relief effort the salvation army received so many donations of clothes footwear blankets food and money that its storage facilities were overfilled forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed 57 a hurricane relief fund was established to coordinate financial donations ultimately raising about 5.3 million cad the fund received donations from organisations companies and individuals including pope pius xii the ford motor company of canada the united church of canada laura secord candy shops and the british-american oil company a portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses 57 the toronto and region conservation authority was created after the storm to manage the area's floodplains and rivers such as building dams 58 the heavily flooded areas were expropriated and barred from rebuilding homes and most of the land was later converted into an extensive park system along toronto's rivers a footbridge dedicated to the victims crosses the humber river in raymore park which was the former raymore drive 59 retirement as a result of the catastrophic damage and severe death tolls in the caribbean united states and canada the name hazel was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane however since it was retired before the inception of naming lists with the modern six-year cycle it was not directly replaced with any particular name 60 see also tropical cyclones portal list of north carolina hurricanes 19501979 list of canadian hurricanes list of retired atlantic hurricane names raymore drive hurricane sandy  a
