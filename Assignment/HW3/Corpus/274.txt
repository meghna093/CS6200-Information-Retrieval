turboprop  wikipedianot to be confused with propfan a fairchild f-27 representative of the 2nd generation of modern rolls-royce dart turboprop powered aircraft after the initial success of the 1950s era vickers viscount an atr-72 a typical modern turboprop aircraft a turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller 1 in contrast to a turbojet the engine's exhaust gases do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust since almost all of the engine's power is used to drive the propeller in its simplest form a turboprop consists of an intake compressor combustor turbine and a propelling nozzle air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor where the fuel-air mixture then combusts the hot combustion gases expand through the turbine some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor the rest is transmitted through the reduction gearing to the propeller further expansion of the gases occurs in the propelling nozzle where the gases exhaust to atmospheric pressure the propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop technological aspects flow past a turboprop engine in operation exhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favor of shaft power which is obtained by extracting additional power up to that necessary to drive the compressor from turbine expansion owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low 2]         [22 it first flew on 20 september 1945 from their experience with the trent rolls-royce developed the rolls-royce clyde the first turboprop engine to be fully type certificated for military and civil use 23 and the dart which became one of the most reliable turboprop engines ever built dart production continued for more than fifty years the dart-powered vickers viscount was the first turboprop aircraft of any kind to go into production and sold in large numbers 24 it was also the first four-engined turboprop its first flight was on 16 july 1948 the world's first single engined turboprop aircraft was the armstrong siddeley mamba-powered boulton paul balliol which first flew on 24 march 1948.[25 the soviet union built on german world war ii development by junkers motorenwerke while bmw heinkel-hirth and daimler-benz also developed and partially tested designs citation needed while the soviet union had the technology to create the airframe for a jet-powered strategic bomber comparable to boeing's b-52 stratofortress they instead produced the tupolev tu-95 bear powered with four kuznetsov nk-12 turboprops mated to eight contra-rotating propellers two per nacelle with supersonic tip speeds to achieve maximum cruise speeds in excess of 575 mph faster than many of the first jet aircraft and comparable to jet cruising speeds for most missions the bear would serve as their most successful long-range combat and surveillance aircraft and symbol of soviet power projection throughout the end of the 20th century the usa would incorporate contra-rotating turboprop engines such as the ill-fated twin-turbine allison t40  essentially a twinned up pair of allison t38 turboprop engines driving contra-rotating propellers  into a series of experimental aircraft during the 1950s with aircraft powered with the t40 like the convair r3y tradewind flying boat never entering u s navy service the first american turboprop engine was the general electric xt31 first used in the experimental consolidated vultee xp-81.[26 the xp-81 first flew in december 1945 the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power the technology of the allison's earlier t38 design evolved into the allison t56 with quartets of the t56s being used to power the lockheed electra airliner its military maritime patrol derivative the p-3 orion and the widely produced c-130 hercules military transport aircraft one of the most produced turboprop engines used in civil aviation is the pratt  whitney canada pt6 engine citation needed the first turbine-powered shaft-driven helicopter was the kaman k-225 a development of charles kaman's k-125 synchropter which used a boeing t50 turboshaft engine to power it on 11 december 1951.[27 usage propulsive efficiency comparison for various gas turbine engine configurations compared to turbofans turboprops are most efficient at flight speeds below 725 km h 450 mph 390 knots because the jet velocity of the propeller and exhaust is relatively low modern turboprop airliners operate at nearly the same speed as small regional jet airliners but burn two-thirds of the fuel per passenger 28 however compared to a turbojet which can fly at high altitude for enhanced speed and fuel efficiency a propeller aircraft has a lower ceiling the most common application of turboprop engines in civilian aviation is in small commuter aircraft where their greater power and reliability offsets their higher initial cost and fuel consumption turboprop-powered aircraft have become popular for bush airplanes such as the cessna caravan and quest kodiak as jet fuel is easier to obtain in remote areas than avgas citation needed due to the high price of turboprop engines they are mostly used where high-performance short-takeoff and landing stol capability and efficiency at modest flight speeds are required turboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft but the tupolev tu-114 can reach 470 kt 870 km h 541 mph large military and civil aircraft such as the lockheed l-188 electra and the tupolev tu-95 have also used turboprop power the airbus a400m is powered by four europrop tp400 engines which are the third most powerful turboprop engines ever produced after the eleven megawatt-output kuznetsov nk-12 and 10.4 mw-output progress d-27.[citation needed some commercial aircraft with turboprop engines include the bombardier dash 8
