sea surface temperature  wikipedia this is a daily global sea surface temperature sst data set produced on december 20th 2013 at 1-km resolution also known as ultra-high resolution by the jpl roms regional ocean modeling system group weekly average sea surface temperature for the world ocean during the first week of february 2011 during a period of la nia play media sea surface temperature and flows sea surface temperature sst is the water temperature close to the ocean's surface the exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used but it is between 1 millimetre 0.04 in and 20 metres 70 ft below the sea surface air masses in the earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of tropical cyclogenesis over the earth's oceans tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake due to turbulent mixing of the upper 30 metres 100 ft of the ocean sst changes diurnally like the air above it but to a lesser degree there is less sst variation on breezy days than on calm days in addition ocean currents such as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo can effect sst's on multi-decadal time scales 1 a major impact results from the global thermohaline circulation which affects average sst significantly throughout most of the world's oceans coastal ssts can cause offshore winds to generate upwelling which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses but shallower waters over a continental shelf are often warmer onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant such as the northwest coast of south america its values are important within numerical weather prediction as the sst influences the atmosphere above such as in the formation of sea breezes and sea fog it is also used to calibrate measurements from weather satellites measurement temperature profile of the surface layer of the ocean a at night and b during the day there are a variety of techniques for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured away from the immediate sea surface general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement this is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean's surface and strong vertical temperature gradients a diurnal thermocline 2 sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the top portion of the ocean known as the near-surface layer 3 thermometers sst was one of the first oceanographic variables to be measured benjamin franklin suspended a mercury thermometer from a ship while travelling between the united states and europe in his survey of the gulf stream in the late eighteenth century sst was later measured by dipping a thermometer into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface the first automated technique for determining sst was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships which was underway by 1963 these observations have a warm bias of around 0.6 c 1 f due to the heat of the engine room 4 this bias has led to changes in the perception of global warming since 2000.  [40 at heights near the tropopause the 30-year average temperature as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990 was 77 c 132 f 41 a recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained
