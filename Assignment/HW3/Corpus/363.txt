accumulated cyclone energy  wikipediaaccumulated cyclone energy ace is a measure used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones and entire tropical cyclone seasons particularly the north atlantic hurricane season it uses an approximation of the wind energy used by a tropical system over its lifetime and is calculated every six hours the ace of a season is the sum of the aces for each storm and takes into account the number strength and duration of all the tropical storms in the season the highest ace calculated for a single storm is 82 for hurricane typhoon ioke in 2006.[1 calculation the ace of a season is calculated by summing the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm wind speed 35 knots 65 km h 40 mph or higher at six-hour intervals since the calculation is sensitive to the starting point of the six-hour intervals the convention is to use 00:00 06:00 12:00 and 18:00 utc if any storms of a season happen to cross years the storm's ace counts for the previous year 2 the numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable one unit of ace equals 104 kn2 and for use as an index the unit is assumed thus where vmax is estimated sustained wind speed in knots kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity and by adding together the energy per some interval of time the accumulated energy is found as the duration of a storm increases more values are summed and the ace also increases such that longer-duration storms may accumulate a larger ace than more-powerful storms of lesser duration although ace is a value proportional to the energy of the system it is not a direct calculation of energy the mass of the moved air and therefore the size of the storm would show up in a real energy calculation a related quantity is hurricane destruction potential hdp which is ace but only calculated for the time where the system is a hurricane 3 competing measurement metrics ace focuses upon the most intense winds concentrated in a storm's center whereas the actual destructive power of a storm depends upon the total area impacted with damaging winds waves and storm surge the metric integrated kinetic energy ike developed in 2007 more accurately reflects the destructive potential it examines the kinetic energy that forces a storm surge and creates high waves as well as the horizontal wind loads over the full storm this metric yields a time specific value for a storm and doesn't account for the destruction caused by a storm over its entire life therefore in 2013 the researchers at the university of florida created a metric called track integrated kinetic energy tike tike expands the concept by accumulating ike over the lifespan of an individual tropical cyclone and a total value for all named tropical cyclones in the season 4 atlantic basin ace 50 100 150 200 250 300 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 categories a season's ace is used by noaa and others to categorize the hurricane season into 3 groups by its activity 5 measured over the period 19512000 for the atlantic basin the median annual index was 87.5 and the mean annual index was 93.2 the noaa categorization system divides seasons into above-normal season an ace value above 111 120 of the 19812010 median provided at least two of the following three parameters are also exceeded number of tropical storms 12 hurricanes 6 and major hurricanes 2 near-normal season neither above-normal nor below normal below-normal season an ace value below 66 71.4 of the 19812010 median or none of the following three parameters are exceeded number of tropical storms 9 hurricanes 4 and major hurricanes 1 according to the noaa categorization system for the atlantic the most recent above-normal season is the 2017 season the most recent near-normal season is the 2014 season and the most recent below normal season is the 2015 season hyperactivity the term hyperactive is used by goldenberg et al 2001 [6 based on a different weighting algorithm[7 reference link is broken need new citatation which places more weight on major hurricanes but typically equating to an ace of about 153 175 of the 19512000 median or more individual storms the highest ever ace estimated for a single storm in the atlantic is 73.6 for the san ciriaco hurricane in 1899 this single storm had an ace higher than many whole atlantic storm seasons other atlantic storms with high aces include hurricane ivan in 2004 with an ace of 70.4 hurricane irma in 2017 with an ace of 66.6 the great charleston hurricane of 1893 with an ace of 63.5 hurricane isabel in 2003 with an ace of 63.3 and the 1932 cuba hurricane with an ace of 59.8.[8 the highest ace of a tropical storm was tropical storm alice of 1953 which attained an ace of 9.6 the highest ace of a category 1 hurricane was hurricane nadine of 2012 which attained an ace of 26.3 the lowest ace of a tropical storm was tropical storm chris of 2000 which was a tropical storm for only six hours and had an ace of 0.1 the lowest ace of any hurricane was the escuminac hurricane of 1959 which was only active for one day and had an ace of just 1.2 the lowest ace of a major hurricane category 3 or higher was 1960's hurricane ethel and 1969's hurricane gerda each with an ace of 5.3.[9 the only years since 1950 to feature two storms with an ace index of over 40 points have been 1966 2003 and 2004 and the only year to feature three storms is 2017.[citation needed the following table shows those storms in the atlantic basin from 19502017 that have attained over 40 points of ace 9 atlantic hurricane seasons 18512017 ace data for the atlantic hurricane season is less reliable prior to the modern satellite era but noaa has analyzed the best available information dating back to 1851 the 1933 atlantic hurricane season is considered the highest ace on record with a total of 259[10 for the current season or
