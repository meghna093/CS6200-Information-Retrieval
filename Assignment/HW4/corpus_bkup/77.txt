surface 1 fog can be considered a type of low-lying cloud and is heavily influenced by nearby bodies of water topography and wind conditions in turn fog has affected many human activities such as shipping travel and warfare definition the term fog is typically distinguished from the more generic term cloud in that fog is low-lying and the moisture in the fog is often generated locally such as from a nearby body of water like a lake or the ocean or from nearby moist ground or marshes 2 by definition fog reduces visibility to less than 1 kilometre 0.62 mi whereas mist causes lesser impairment of visibility 3 for aviation purposes in the uk a visibility of less than 5 kilometres 3.1 mi but greater than 999 metres 3,278 ft is considered to be mist if the relative humidity is 70 or greater below 70 haze is reported 4]   [25 in the old farmer's almanac in the calendar for december the phrase beware the pogonip regularly appears in his anthology smoke bellew jack london described a pogonip which surrounded the main characters killing one of them the phenomenon is also extremely common in the inland areas of the pacific northwest with temperatures in the 10 to 30 f 12 to 1 c range the columbia plateau experiences this phenomenon most years due to temperature inversions sometimes lasting for as long as three weeks the fog typically begins forming around the area of the columbia river and expands sometimes covering the land to distances as far away as lapine oregon almost 150 miles 240 km due south of the river and into south central washington frozen fog also known as ice fog is any kind of fog where the droplets have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair generally this requires temperatures at or below 35 c 31 f making it common only in and near the arctic and antarctic regions 26 it is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals often reported in barrow alaska ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars morning freezing fog in elko nevada pogonip fog in virginia city nevada from an early 20th-century postcard tree in field during extreme cold with frozen fog topographical influences fog over the pedra do sino bell rock left and dedo de deus god's finger right peaks in the serra dos rgos national park rio de janeiro state brazil up-slope fog or hill fog forms when winds blow air up a slope called orographic lift adiabatically cooling it as it rises and causing the moisture in it to condense this often causes freezing fog on mountaintops where the cloud ceiling would not otherwise be low enough valley fog forms in mountain valleys often during winter it is essentially a radiation fog confined by local topography and can last for several days in calm conditions in california's central valley valley fog is often referred to as tule fog sea and coastal fog sea fog also known as haar or fret is heavily influenced by the presence of sea spray and microscopic airborne salt crystals clouds of all types require minute hygroscopic particles upon which water vapor can condense over the ocean surface the most common particles are salt from salt spray produced by breaking waves except in areas of storminess the most common areas of breaking waves are located near coastlines hence the greatest densities of airborne salt particles are there condensation on salt particles has been observed to occur at humidities as low as 70 thus fog can occur even in relatively dry air in suitable locations such as the california coast typically such lower humidity fog is preceded by a transparent mistiness along the coastline as condensation competes with evaporation a phenomenon that is typically noticeable by beachgoers in the afternoon another recently discovered source of condensation nuclei for coastal fog is kelp seaweed researchers have found that under stress intense sunlight strong evaporation etc  kelp releases particles of iodine which in turn become nuclei for condensation of water vapor causing fog that diffuses direct sunlight 27 sea smoke also called steam fog or evaporation fog is the most localized form and is created by cold air passing over warmer water or moist land 22 it often causes freezing fog or sometimes hoar frost arctic sea smoke is similar to sea smoke but occurs when the air is very cold instead of condensing into water droplets columns of freezing rising and condensing water vapor is formed the water vapor produces the sea smoke fog and is usually misty and smoke-like 28 gara fog near the coast of chile and peru 29 occurs when typical fog produced by the sea travels inland but suddenly meets an area of hot air this causes the water particles of fog to shrink by evaporation producing a transparent mist garua fog is nearly invisible yet it still forces drivers to use windshield wipers because of deposition of liquid water on hard surfaces fog rolls into seattle from the sea sea fog or fret encroaching on brighton pier sea fog in the arctic ocean near the island of jan mayen visibility effects heavy fog on a road near baden austria light fog reduces visibility on a suburban street rendering the cyclist very hazy at about 200 m 220 yd the limit of visibility is about 400 m 440 yd which is before the end of the street depending on the concentration of the droplets visibility in fog can range from the appearance of haze to almost zero visibility many lives are lost each year worldwide from accidents involving fog conditions on the highways including multiple-vehicle collisions the aviation travel industry is affected by the severity of fog conditions even though modern auto-landing computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff safe operations are difficult in thick fog and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve a solution for landing returning military aircraft developed in world war ii was called fog investigation and dispersal operation fido it involved burning enormous amounts of fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft the high energy demands of this method discourage its use for routine operations shadows sutro tower casts a 3-dimensional fog shadow shadows are cast through fog in three dimensions the fog is dense enough to be illuminated by light that passes through gaps in a structure or tree but thin enough to let a large quantity of that light pass through to illuminate points further on as a result object shadows appear as beams oriented in a direction parallel to the light source these voluminous shadows are created the same way as crepuscular rays which are the shadows of clouds in fog it is solid objects that cast shadows sound propagation and acoustic effects see also acoustic location acoustic shadow and foghorn sound typically travels fastest and farthest through solids then liquids then gases such as the atmosphere sound is affected during fog conditions due to the small distances between water droplets and air temperature differences molecular effect though fog is essentially liquid water the many droplets are separated by small air gaps high-pitched sounds have a high frequency which in turn means they have a short wavelength to transmit a high frequency wave air must move back and forth very quickly short-wavelength high-pitched sound waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets partially cancelling and dissipating their energy a process called damping in contrast low pitched notes with a low frequency and a long wavelength move the air less rapidly and less often and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further which is why foghorns use a low-pitched tone 30 temperature effect a fog can be caused by a temperature inversion where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog while warmer air sits above it the inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back toward the ground allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface a temperature inversion increases the distance that lower frequency sounds can travel by reflecting the sound between the ground and the inversion layer 31 record extremes the foggiest place in the world[citation needed is hamilton new zealand followed closely by the grand banks off the coast of newfoundland the meeting place of the cold labrador current from the north and the much warmer gulf stream from the south some of the foggiest land areas in the world include argentia newfoundland and point reyes california each with over 200 foggy days per year citation needed even in generally warmer southern europe thick fog and localized fog are often found in lowlands and valleys such as the lower part of the po valley and the arno and tiber valleys in italy ebro valley in northeastern spain as well as on the swiss plateau especially in the seeland area in late autumn and winter citation needed other notably foggy areas include coastal chile in the south coastal namibia nord greenland and the severnaya zemlya islands as a water source redwood forests in california receive approximately 3040 of their moisture from coastal fog by way of fog drip change in climate patterns could result in relative drought in these areas 32 some animals including insects depend on wet fog as a principal source of water particularly in otherwise desert climes as along many african coastal areas some coastal communities use fog nets to extract moisture from the atmosphere where groundwater pumping and rainwater collection are insufficient artificial fog artificial fog is man-made fog that is usually created by vaporizing a water and glycol-based or glycerine-based fluid the fluid is injected into a heated metal block and evaporates quickly the resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent upon coming into contact with cool outside air the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog 33 such fog machines are primarily used for entertainment applications historical references see also pea soup fog fog of war and theatrical smoke and fog the presence of fog has often played a key role in historical events such as strategic battles one example is the battle of long island august 27 1776 when american general george washington and his command were able to evade imminent capture by the british army using fog to conceal their escape another example is d-day june 6 1944 during world war ii when the allies landed on the beaches of normandy france during fog conditions both positive and negative results were reported from both sides during that battle due to impaired visibility 34 gallery maple tree with red
