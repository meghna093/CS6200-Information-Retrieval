tropical cyclones in the bay of bengal[15 found increases in both premonsoon precipitation and tropical cyclone intensity as a result of enhanced large-scale monsoon circulation after 1979 the deepened monsoon trough in the bay of bengal not only affects cyclone frequency and timing but also acts to direct more cyclones towards myanmar increased anthropogenic aerosols likely contributed to
