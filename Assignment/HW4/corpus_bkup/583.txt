[11 krystal scanlon of gigwise gave the album a positive review commenting cover drives first three singles have already scored barbadian band huge hit singles so it was obvious the band have already got their career off to a good start  she continued saying the opening track bajan style intro is just a perfect taster of what the album has to offer with a hint of an early black eyed peas tone to some of their songs this album offers its listeners a variety of solid beats catchy lyrics and an overall good feeling the background beat of headphones holds a similar style of tune to no doubt's hey baby  so if youre a fan of the lovely gwen stefani this is definitely worth a try lick ya down rivals rihanna for the radio-friendly sounds heard on her recent album but that said cover drive still have their own unique style and this song is equally catchy just like the rest of this album with their front girl amanda being labeled the new bajan queen of the music scene rihanna is definitely going to have a little competition on her hands in the charts wrongside is another standout tune and has a vibe similar to shaggys it wasn't me with the backing rhythm while a lot of these songs do have a catchy beat and could be considered similar its safe to say there is still a lot of variety amongst the songs  from calmer slow songs to upbeat songs that make you want to dance cover drive are definitely some way from their pop peak on this their first album but theres no doubt that this is going to set the bar high itll be interesting to see what song they release next because they certainly have a good set to choose from 12 lewis corner of digital spy awarded the album three out of five stars commenting from the off it's clear the group have been influenced by other mixed quartets no doubt and the black eyed peas as such singer amanda reifer serves as the fergie gwen stefani and takes the lead on the majority of the tracks she can flip from butter-wouldn't-melt on mid-tempo love song twilight to passionate and sassy on debut single lick ya down in an instant  and she pulls it off with ease however it's headphones that showcases the band's real ability as musicians boy i want to put you on repeat you will be the bass of my heartbeat  amanda swoons over bouncy beats and funk-driven guitar riffs packed with more tropical flavour and sweetness than an ice-cold can of lilt sparks proves they are more than capable of taking on the trickier ballads producing an ear-snagging pop melody with a floating piano riff and radio-friendly vocals penultimate cut hurricane injects a welcome burst of back-end energy after non-starters wrongside and can't live in a world begin to pull things down like all good cricket matches there may be quiet spells during the game but it's only the final result that really matters luckily for cover drive their very first innings contains some very memorable hits 13 alex macpherson of the guardian awarded the album three out of five stars saying the summer dancehall hit once an annual staple of the british charts has been on a hiatus in recent years  as bajan four-piece cover drive have spotted their compatriot rihanna may have long abandoned reggae-lite pop for foghorn electro but her early years provide fertile inspiration for cover drive from the steel pans and airhorns of breakthrough hit lick ya down to the fluttering yearning explode lead singer amanda reifer could be mistaken for rihanna albeit a less charismatic version  a quality that also explains why cover drive's breezy beach party-vibes are highly likable but a bit lightweight still in an era when most pop stars strategy is to bludgeon you into submission that's refreshing 14 track listing no title writer s producer s length 1 bajan
