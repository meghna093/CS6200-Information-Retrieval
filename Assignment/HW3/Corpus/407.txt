emergency management  wikipediaemergency management is the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergenciespreparedness response and recoveryin order to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards including disasters often interchanged with disaster management it is not be confused with it the world health organization defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state turning into a disaster thus emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a disaster which is harder to recover from 1 emergency planning ideals this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to

occurring and failing that should develop a good action plan to mitigate the results and effects of any emergencies as time goes on and more data becomes available usually through the study of emergencies as they occur a plan should evolve the development of emergency plans is a cyclical process common to many risk management disciplines such as business continuity and security risk management as set out below recognition or identification of risks ranking or evaluation of risks responding to significant risks tolerate treat transfer terminate resourcing controls and planning reaction planning reporting  monitoring risk performance reviewing the risk management framework there are a number of guidelines and publications regarding emergency planning published by various professional organizations such as asis national fire protection association nfpa and the international association of emergency managers iaem there are very few emergency management specific standards and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standards in order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks hopefully to reduce their probability of occurring in the event that an emergency does occur managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations post-incident it is essential for an organisation to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be activated implementation ideals this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to

methodical manner to ensure it is up-to-date in the event of an emergency emergency managers generally follow a common process to anticipate assess prevent prepare respond and recover from an incident 2 pre-incident training and testing emergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs training plans should include internal people contractors and civil protection partners and should state the nature and frequency of training and testing testing of a plan's effectiveness should occur regularly in instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space joint emergency plans formally agreed to by all parties should be put into place drills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency and people who will be affected drills are held to prepare for the hazards of fires tornadoes lockdown for protection earthquakes etc communicating and incident assessment communication is one of the key issues during any emergency pre-planning of communications is critical miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarily once an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken following assessment the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan the steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible the critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalized the communication policy must be well known and rehearsed and all targeted audiences or publics and individuals must be alert all communication infrastructure must be as prepared as possible with all

response and recovery http www fema gov mission-areas prevention it focuses on preventing the human hazard primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels designed to provide permanent protection from disasters also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans environmental planning and design standards in january 2005 167 governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the hyogo framework citation needed preventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery public safety canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach in 2009 federal provincial territorial ministers endorsed a national disaster mitigation strategy mitigation strategy disaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs preventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters in earthquake prone areas these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an earthquake valve to instantly shut off the natural gas supply seismic retrofits of property and the securing of items inside a building the latter may include the mounting of furniture refrigerators water heaters and breakables to the walls and the addition of cabinet latches in flood prone areas houses can be built on poles stilts in areas prone to prolonged electricity black-outs installation of a generator ensures continuation of electrical service the construction of storm cellars and fallout shelters are further examples of personal mitigative actions on a national level governments might implement large scale mitigation measures after the monsoon floods of 2010 the punjab government subsequently constructed 22 disaster-resilient model villages comprising 1885 single-storey homes together with schools and health centres 3 one of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the red river floodway the building of the floodway was a joint provincial federal undertaking to protect the city of winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the red river basin it cost 62.7 million to build in the 1960s since then the floodway has been used over 20 times its use during the 1997 red river flood alone saved an estimated 4.5 billion in costs from potential damage to the city 4 the floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincial federal initiative preparedness an airport emergency preparedness exercise preparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a disaster occurs this equipment and these procedures can be used to reduce vulnerability to disaster to mitigate the impacts of a disaster or to respond more efficiently in an emergency the federal emergency management agency fema has set out a basic four-stage vision of preparedness flowing from mitigation to preparedness to response to recovery and back to mitigation in a circular planning process 5 this circular overlapping model has been modified by other agencies taught in emergency class and discussed in academic papers 6 fema also operates a building science branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property 7 fema advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted fema has subsequently prepared for this contingency by purchasing hundreds of thousands of freeze dried food emergency meals ready to eat mre's to dispense to the communities where emergency shelter and evacuations are implemented some guidelines for household preparedness have been put online by the state of colorado on the topics of water food tools and so on 8 emergency preparedness can be difficult to measure 9 cdc focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of its public health efforts through a variety of measurement and assessment programs 10 local emergency planning committees local emergency planning committees lepcs are required by the united states environmental protection agency under the emergency planning and community right-to-know act to develop an emergency response plan review the plan at least annually and provide information about chemicals in the community to local citizens 11 this emergency preparedness effort focuses on hazards presented by use and storage of extremely hazardous and toxic chemicals 12 particular requirements of lepcs include identification of facilities and transportation routes of extremely hazardous substances description of emergency response procedures on and off site designation of a community coordinator and facility emergency coordinator s to implement the plan outline of emergency notification procedures description of how to determine the probable affected area and population by releases description of local emergency equipment and facilities and the persons responsible for them outline of evacuation plans a training program for emergency responders including schedules methods and schedules for exercising emergency response plans according to the epa many lepcs have expanded their activities beyond the requirements of epcra encouraging accident prevention and risk reduction and addressing homeland security in their communities and the agency offers advice on how to evaluate the effectiveness of these committees 13 preparedness measures the image captions in this section require cleanup to comply with

preparedness stages between all hazard and individual planning generally involving some combination of both mitigation and response planning business continuity planning encourages businesses to have a disaster recovery plan community and faith-based organizations mitigation efforts promote field response teams and inter-agency planning 15 classroom response kit school-based response teams cover

has all these three services combined into one dispatch for the best multi-coordinated response to an incident or an emergency and also facilitates in information management emergency communication and care of citizens these services are the main structure for a response to an emergency it can happen that for a specific emergency the co-operation with an other service is needed for instance the ministry of defence water board s or rijkswaterstaat the veiligheidsregio can integrate these other services into their structure by adding them to specific conferences on operational or administrative level all regions operate according to the coordinated regional incident management system united kingdom following the 2000 fuel protests and severe flooding that same year as well as the foot-and-mouth crisis in 2001 the united kingdom passed the civil contingencies act 2004 cca the cca defined some organisations as category 1 and 2 responders setting responsibilities regarding emergency preparedness and response it is managed by the civil contingencies secretariat through regional resilience forums and local authorities disaster management training is generally conducted at the local level and consolidated through professional courses that can be taken at the emergency planning college diplomas undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications can be gained at universities throughout the country the institute of emergency management is a charity established in 1996 providing consulting services for the government media and commercial sectors there are a number of

the uk was carried out on 20 may 2007 near belfast northern ireland a simulated plane crash-landing at belfast international airport staff from five hospitals and three airports participated in the drill and almost 150 international observers assessed its effectiveness 110 united states disaster management in the united states has utilized the functional all-hazards approach for over 20 years in which managers develop processes such as communication  warning or sheltering rather than developing single-hazard or threat focused plans e g a tornado plan processes are then mapped to specific hazards or threats with the manager looking for gaps overlaps and conflicts between processes given these notions emergency managers must identify contemplate and assess possible man-made threats and natural threats that may affect their respective locales 111 because of geographical differences throughout the nation a variety of different threats affect communities among the states thus although similarities may exist no two emergency plans will be completely identical additionally each locale has different resources and capacities e g budgets personnel equipment etc  for dealing with emergencies 112 each individual community must craft its own unique emergency plan that addresses potential threats that are specific to the locality 113 this creates a plan more resilient to unique events because all common processes are defined and it encourages planning done by the stakeholders who are closer to the individual processes such as a traffic management plan written by a public works director this type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies which require the development of hazard threat specific plans such as the development of specific h1n1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plans in the united states all disasters are initially local with local authorities with usually a police fire or ems agency taking charge many local municipalities may also have a separate dedicated office of emergency management oem along with personnel and equipment if the event becomes overwhelming to the local government state emergency

security dhs is the lead federal agency for emergency management the united states and its territories are broken down into ten regions for fema's emergency management purposes fema supports but does not override state authority the citizen corps is an organization of volunteer service programs administered locally and coordinated nationally by dhs which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education training and outreach most disaster response is carried out by volunteer organizations in the us the red cross is chartered by congress to coordinate disaster response services it is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees religious organizations with their ability to provide volunteers quickly are usually integral during the response process the largest being the salvation army 114 with a primary focus on chaplaincy and rebuilding and southern baptists who focus on food preparation and distribution 115 as well as cleaning up after floods and fires chaplaincy mobile shower units chainsaw crews and more with over 65,000 trained volunteers southern baptist disaster relief is one of the largest disaster relief organizations in the us 116 similar services are also provided by methodist relief services the lutherans and samaritan's purse unaffiliated volunteers show up at most large disasters to prevent abuse by criminals and for the safety of the volunteers procedures have been implemented within most response agencies to manage and effectively use these suvs spontaneous unaffiliated volunteers 117 the us congress established the center for excellence in disaster management and humanitarian assistance coe as the principal agency to promote disaster preparedness in the asia-pacific

risks in emergency or disaster management the smaug model of identifying and prioritizing risk of hazards associated with natural and technological threats is an effective tool smaug stands for seriousness manageability acceptability urgency and growth and are the criteria used for prioritization of hazard risks the smaug model provides an effective means of prioritizing hazard risks based upon the aforementioned criteria in order to address the risks posed by the hazards to the avail of effecting effective mitigation reduction response and recovery methods 123 seriousness can be defined as the relative impact in terms of people and dollars  this includes the potential for lives to be lost and potential for injury as well as the physical social and as mentioned economic losses that may be incurred manageability can be defined as the relative ability to mitigate or reduce the hazard through managing the hazard or the community or both hazards presenting a high risk and as such requiring significant amounts of risk reduction initiatives will be rated high 123 acceptability  the degree to which the risk of hazard is acceptable in terms of political environmental social and economic impact urgency  this is related to the probability of risk of hazard and is defined in terms of how imperative it is to address the hazard 123 growth  this is the potential for the hazard or event to expand or increase in either probability or risk to community or both should vulnerability increase potential for growth may also increase an example of the numerical ratings for each of the four criteria is shown below 124 see also centers for disease control and prevention's information on specific types of emergencies emergency preparedness and response resources by the national
