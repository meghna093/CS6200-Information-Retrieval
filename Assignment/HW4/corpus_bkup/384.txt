journal homepage online access online archive nature is an english multidisciplinary scientific journal first published on 4 november 1869.      here are unarguable faux pas in our history these include the rejection of cherenkov radiation hideki yukawa's meson work on photosynthesis by johann deisenhofer robert huber and hartmut michel and the initial rejection but eventual acceptance of stephen hawking's black-hole radiation 35 from 20002001 a series of five fraudulent papers by jan hendrik schn was published in nature the papers about semiconductors were revealed to contain falsified data and other scientific fraud in 2003 nature retracted the papers the schn scandal was not limited to nature other prominent journals such as science and physical review also retracted papers by schn 36 in june 1988 after nearly a year of guided scrutiny from its editors nature published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing dr jacques benveniste and his team's work studying human basophil degranulation in the presence of extremely dilute antibody serum 37 in short their paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils defying the physical law of mass action the paper excited substantial media attention in paris chiefly because their research sought funding from homeopathic medicine companies public inquiry prompted nature to mandate an extensive stringent and scientifically questionable experimental replication in benveniste's lab through which his team's results were categorically disputed 38 before publishing one of its most famous discoveries watson and crick's 1953 paper on the structure of dna nature did not send the paper out for peer review john maddox nature's editor stated the watson and crick paper was not peer-reviewed by nature the paper could not have been refereed its correctness is self-evident no referee working in the field could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure 39 an earlier error occurred when enrico fermi submitted his breakthrough paper on the weak interaction theory of beta decay nature turned down the paper because it was considered too remote from reality 40 fermi's paper was published by zeitschrift fr physik in 1934,[41 and finally published by nature five years later citation needed after fermi's work had been widely accepted science fiction in 1999 nature began publishing science fiction short stories the brief vignettes are printed in a series called futures the stories appeared in 1999 and 2000 again in 2005 and 2006 and have appeared weekly since july 2007.[42 sister publication nature physics also printed stories in 2007 and 2008.[43 in 2005 nature was awarded the european science fiction society's best publisher award for the futures series 44 one hundred of the nature stories between 1999 and 2006 were published as the collection futures from nature in 2008.[45 publication
