list of category 5 pacific hurricanes  wikipedia category 5 hurricanes are tropical cyclones that reach category 5 intensity on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale they are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet earth they are rare in the eastern pacific ocean and generally form only once every several years in general category 5s form in clusters in single years landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere the term hurricane is used for tropical cyclones in the pacific ocean north of the equator and east of the international date line a category 5 pacific hurricane is therefore a tropical cyclone in the north pacific ocean that reached category 5 intensity east of the international dateline identical phenomena in the north pacific ocean west of the dateline are called typhoons or super typhoons category 5 super typhoons generally happen several times per season so cyclones of that intensity are not exceptional for that region this difference in terminology therefore excludes storms such as super typhoon paka and super typhoon oliwa of 1997 and super typhoon genevieve of 2014 which formed east of the dateline but did not reach category 5 intensity until after crossing the dateline statistics saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale td ts c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 a category 5 hurricane is defined as having sustained windspeeds of at least 137 knots 158 mph 254 km h over a one-minute period 10 metres 33 ft above the ground 1] [17 the reason for the lack of landfalls is that tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west 18 in the atlantic this sends hurricanes towards north america in the eastern pacific this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear hawaii the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern pacific is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds see also tropical cyclones portal weather portal book category 5 pacific hurricanes list of tropical cyclones list of the most intense tropical cyclones list of pacific hurricane seasons list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes list of category 4 pacific hurricanes references v t e category 5 pacific hurricanes 1950s patsy 1959 1970s ava 1973 1990s emilia 1994 gilma 1994 john 1994 guillermo 1997 linda 1997 2000s elida 2002 hernan 2002 kenna 2002 ioke 2006 rick 2009 2010s celia 2010 marie 2014 patricia 2015 book category tropical cyclones portal
