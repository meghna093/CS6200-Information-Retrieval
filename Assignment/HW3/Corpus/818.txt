hurricane season hurricane gloria was the first significant system to strike the northeastern united states since hurricane agnes in 1972 and the first major storm to affect new york and long island directly since hurricane donna in 1960 it was also the most intense category 4 hurricane that did not attain category 5 status until surpassed by hurricane opal in the 1995 atlantic hurricane season it was a powerful cape verde-type hurricane that formed during the 1985 atlantic hurricane season originating from a tropical wave on september 16 in the eastern atlantic ocean after remaining a weak tropical cyclone for several days gloria intensified into a hurricane on september 22 north of the lesser antilles during that time the storm had moved generally westward although it turned to the northwest due to a weakening of the ridge gloria quickly intensified on september 24 and the next day reached peak winds of 145 mph 230 km h the hurricane weakened before striking the outer banks of north carolina on september 27 later that day gloria made two subsequent landfalls on long island and later western connecticut before becoming extratropical on september 28 over new england the remnants moved through atlantic canada eventually dissipating on october 2 before gloria made landfall the national hurricane center issued hurricane warnings at some point for the east coast of the united states from south carolina to maine hundreds of thousands of people evacuated and the hurricane was described as the storm of the century in general gloria's strongest winds remained east of the center which largely spared locations from north carolina to new jersey and the passage at low tide reduced storm surge hurricane-force winds and gusts affected much of the path which knocked down trees and power lines this left over 4 million people without power including the worst power outage in connecticut history related to a natural disaster the extended power outage on long island affecting 1.5 million people at some point caused the long island lighting company to be shut down and be replaced with a public company fallen trees caused six of the storm's fourteen deaths in north carolina high waves damaged many homes along the outer banks and caused heavy beach erosion high waves also damaged piers boats and docks throughout the mid-atlantic states flooding forced several highways to close and in pennsylvania thousands were forced to evacuate their homes the storm surge destroyed 48 homes on long island while the winds damaged the roofs of many more widespread crop damage occurred amounting to about 20 million 1985 usd       [2 gloria was the first significant hurricane to affect new england since hurricane donna in 1960.[9 carolinas and mid-atlantic while

estimated at 8.1 million including 2.4 million in crop damage there was one death in north carolina when a man was struck by a fallen tree 9 throughout much of the mid-atlantic the winds remained generally below hurricane force however winds reached 92 mph 147 km h along the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in virginia and gusts to 89 mph 144 km h in ocean city maryland the strongest winds in the region occurred after the center passed the area due to gloria's fast motion there was minimal coastal flooding because the highest storm surge occurred during low tide generally less than 4.9 ft 1.5 m beach erosion was reported in both maryland and delaware 2 the heaviest rainfall was west of the center statewide peaks included 9.17 in 233 mm at valley forge national historical park in

rainfall in locations including 6.04 inches 153 mm at baltimorewashington international airport 20 in addition some unofficial reports in southeastern virginia indicated amounts of up to 8 inches 200 mm of rain 21 because much of the mid-atlantic experienced the western weaker side of this hurricane damage was relatively light high winds downed numerous trees throughout the area leaving hundreds of thousands without power including 237,000 in new jersey 124,000 in maryland and 56,000 in virginia 22 extreme rainfall in virginia resulted in 5.5 million 1985 usd in damage 21 intense flood waters

trees into buildings and across roads the broadcast tower of wbli-fm toppled on bald hill in farmingville in addition the winds ripped roofs off of many buildings including hangars at the macarthur airport a hangar at the bayport aerodrome and the roof of the islip police station 22 prolonged exposure to high winds and waves led to moderate beach erosion washing away several piers and docks 22 the storm surge though relatively weak destroyed 48 houses on the ocean side of the island gloria's high winds left 683,000 people in new york without power with some lacking electricity for over eleven days 24 new england and canada satellite image of gloria nearing new england while moving across new england gloria was a weakened hurricane that passed quickly through the area though still a

which were driven ashore 26 gloria's high winds downed numerous trees across new england causing minor to moderate damage in the region connecticut received the worst of the hurricane where tree and structural damage was greatest along the coastline storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers and some roadways were underwater during the storm's passage 22 new hampshire was affected only slightly from the hurricane and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding 27 in maine damage was more severe where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees high winds across new england resulted in significant power outages leaving 250,000 in maine 28 in all seven deaths occurred in new england many of which occurred from falling tree limbs 22 while the remnants of gloria were moving through atlantic canada they produced rainfall to the north of the track reaching as high as 4.53 in 115 mm in quebec the highest winds in the country were 58

knocked down power lines affecting more than 1,800 people 29 aftermath see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names on long island thousands were left without power for over a week 9 until the last outages were restored two weeks after the storm on october 8 the long duration without electricity forced hundreds of schools to close extended train times by six hours due to lack of powered crossings and price gouging on food ice and generators the lack of power led to a general disdain for the long island lighting company lilco which increased further when the company left the 40 million 1985 usd repair bill to the ratepayers citing the company's lack of hurricane insurance citizens quickly protested lilco's decision and within years the publicly owned long island power authority was formed 24 residents in both massachusetts and connecticut were also without power for up to one week which caused many food products to spoil due to lack of refrigeration the states brought in workers from other states although the delay in restoring the widespread outages caused many schools to remain closed in connecticut one man was electrocuted while repairing downed power lines 9 about 477,000 connecticut light  power customers in the state lost power a record that was surpassed by the 754,000 who lost power during hurricane irene in 2011.[30 later in 2011 a nor'easter in october left over 830,000 people statewide without power also breaking the record set by gloria 31 in new hampshire most power outages were quickly restored and all were restored within six days in maine all power outages were restored in 11 days 26 in maine most citizens remained indoors during the passage of the hurricane one police officer noted that even the criminals stayed home in the lewiston area restaurants experienced a great surge in business during the power outage after the storm several businesses stored frozen goods for houses without a generator 28 after the storm president ronald reagan declared several counties in new jersey pennsylvania new york rhode island connecticut and massachusetts as federal disaster areas this declaration allowed those counties to apply for disaster assistance 32 in canada the damage was less than expected but confusion related to the storm threat prompted environment canada to research the need for a dedicated hurricane centre in 1986 the following year the canadian hurricane centre was established with offices on both the atlantic and pacific coasts 16 due to its impact the name gloria was retired from the atlantic tropical storm naming list it will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane 33 it was replaced with grace in the 1991 season 4 see also tropical cyclones portal list of retired atlantic hurricane
