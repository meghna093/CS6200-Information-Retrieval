tropical cyclone forecasting  wikipedia part of a series on tropical cyclones formation and naming development structure effects warnings and watches storm surge notable storms climatology and tracking basins rsmcs scales observation forecasting rainfall forecasting rainfall climatology tropical cyclone naming tropical cyclone naming history of tropical cyclone naming list of historic tropical cyclone names list of retired atlantic hurricane names list of retired pacific hurricane names list of retired pacific typhoon names list of retired philippine typhoon names list of retired australian cyclone names list of retired south pacific cyclone names outline of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones portal v t e tropical cyclone forecasting is the science of forecasting where a tropical cyclone's center and its effects are expected to be at some point in the future there are several elements to tropical cyclone forecasting track forecasting intensity forecasting rainfall forecasting storm surge tornado and seasonal forecasting while skill is increasing in regard to track forecasting intensity forecasting skill remains nearly unchanged over the past several years seasonal forecasting began in the 1980s in the atlantic basin and has spread into other basins in the years since history short term the methods through which tropical cyclones are forecast have changed with the passage of time the first known forecasts in the western hemisphere were made by lt col william reed of the corps of royal engineers at barbados in 1847 reed mostly utilized barometric pressure measurements as the basis of his forecasts benito vines introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in havana during the 1870s before the early 1900s though most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations which were then relayed to forecast centers via telegraph it wasnt until the advent of radio in the early twentieth century that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters the 1930s saw the usage of radiosondes in tropical cyclone forecasting the next decade saw the advent of aircraft-based reconnaissance by the military starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943 and the establishment of the hurricane hunters in 1944 in the 1950s coastal weather radars began to be used in the united states and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the hurricane research division began in 1954.   [21 this provided the nhc with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25 or 1 hour 21 atcf was originally developed for use within dos before later being adapted to unix and linux 20 storm surge see also storm surge the main storm surge forecast model in the atlantic basin is slosh which stands for sea lake overland surge from hurricanes 22 it uses the size of a storm its intensity its forward motion and the topography of the coastal plain to estimate the depth of a storm surge at any individual grid point across the united states an accurate forecast track is required in order to produce accurate storm surge forecasts however if the landfall point is uncertain a maximum envelope of water meow map can be generated based on the direction of approach if the forecast track itself is also uncertain a maximum of maximums mom map can be generated which will show the worst possible scenario for a hurricane of a specific strength 23 tornado the location of most tropical cyclone-related tornadoes is their northeast quadrant in the northern hemisphere and southeast quadrant in the southern hemisphere 24 like most of the other forecasts for tropical cyclone effects an accurate track forecast is required in order to produce an accurate tornado threat forecast seasonal forecast see also atlantic multidecadal oscillation and tropical cyclone  long-term_activity_trends by looking at annual variations in various climate parameters forecasters can make predictions about the overall number and intensity of tropical cyclones that will occur in a given season for example when constructing its seasonal outlooks the climate prediction center in the united states considers the effects of the el nio-southern oscillation 2540 year tropical cycle wind shear over the oceans and ocean surface temperature 25 see also tropical cyclones portal hebert box references
