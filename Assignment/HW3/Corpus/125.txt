list of retired atlantic hurricane names  wikipedia this is a cumulative list of previously used tropical cyclone tropical storm and hurricane names which have been indefinitely removed from reuse in the north atlantic region the naming of north atlantic tropical cyclones is currently under the oversight of the hurricane committee of the world meteorological organization this group maintains six alphabetic lists of names with one list used each year this normally results in each name being reused every six years however in the case of a particularly deadly or damaging storm that storm's name is retired and a replacement starting with the same letter is selected to take its place the decision whether to remove a name is made yearly at an annual session of the hurricane committee the practice of retiring storm names was begun by the united states weather bureau in 1955 after major hurricanes carol edna and hazel struck the northeastern united states during the previous year initially their names were retired for 10 years after which time they could be reintroduced however in 1969 the policy was changed to have the names retired indefinitely in 1977 the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa transferred control of the naming lists to the hurricane committee since the formal start of naming during the 1947 atlantic hurricane season an average of one atlantic storm name has been retired each year though many seasons most recently 2014 did not have any names retired the deadliest storm to have its name retired was hurricane mitch which caused over 10,000 fatalities when it struck central america during october 1998 while the costliest storm was hurricane katrina which caused over 108 billion in damage when it struck the u s gulf coast in august 2005.
