nasa transferred the backup skylab to the national air and space museum in 1975 on display in the museum's space hall since 1976 the orbital workshop has been slightly modified to permit viewers to walk through the living quarters 148 mission designations the numerical identification of the manned skylab missions was the cause of some confusion originally the unmanned launch of skylab and the three manned missions to the station were numbered sl-1 through sl-4 during the preparations for the manned missions some documentation was created with a different scheme  slm-1 through slm-3for those missions only william pogue credits pete conrad with asking the skylab program director which scheme should be used for the mission patches and the astronauts were told to use 1-2-3 not 2-3-4 by the time nasa administrators tried to reverse this decision it was too late as all the in-flight clothing had already been manufactured and shipped with the 1-2-3 mission patches 149 mission emblem
