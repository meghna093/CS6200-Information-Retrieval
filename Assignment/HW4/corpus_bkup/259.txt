neritic zone straits pelagic zone oceanic zone seamounts hydrothermal vents cold seeps demersal zone benthic zone v t e an estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it and with a free connection to the open sea 1 estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments they are subject both to marine influencessuch as tides waves and the influx of saline waterand to riverine influencessuch as flows of fresh water and sediment the inflows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world 2 most existing estuaries formed during the holocene epoch with the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,00012,000 years ago 3 estuaries are typically classified according to their geomorphological features or to water-circulation patterns they can have many different names such as bays harbors lagoons inlets or sounds although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and may be fully saline the banks of many estuaries are amongst the most heavily populated areas of the world with about 60 of the world's population living along estuaries and the coast citation needed as a result many estuaries suffer degradation by many factors including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation overgrazing and other poor farming practices overfishing drainage and filling of wetlands eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes pollutants including heavy metals polychlorinated biphenyls radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion 3] [10 physiochemical variation the most important variable characteristics of estuary water are the concentration of dissolved oxygen salinity and sediment load there is extreme spatial variability in salinity with a range of near zero at the tidal limit of tributary rivers to 3.4 at the estuary mouth at any one point the salinity will vary considerably over time and seasons making it a harsh environment for organisms sediment often settles in intertidal mudflats which are extremely difficult to colonize no points of attachment exist for algae so vegetation based habitat is not established clarification needed sediment can also clog feeding and respiratory structures of species and special adaptations exist within mudflat species to cope with this problem lastly dissolved oxygen variation can cause problems for life forms nutrient-rich sediment from man-made sources can promote primary production life cycles perhaps leading to eventual decay removing the dissolved oxygen from the water thus hypoxic or anoxic zones can develop 11 implications for marine life estuaries provide habitats for a large number of organisms and support very high productivity estuaries provide habitats for many fish nurseries depending upon their locations in the world such as salmon and sea trout 12 also migratory bird populations such as the black-tailed godwit 13 make essential use of estuaries two of the main challenges of estuarine life are the variability in salinity and sedimentation many species of fish and invertebrates have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed osmoconformers and osmoregulators many animals also burrow to avoid predation and to live in the more stable sedimental environment however large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand this reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially anoxic conditions which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux phytoplankton are key primary producers in estuaries they move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the tides their productivity is largely dependent upon the turbidity of the water the main phytoplankton present are diatoms and dinoflagellates which are abundant in the sediment it is important to remember that a primary source of food for many organisms on estuaries including bacteria is detritus from the settlement of the sedimentation human impact of the thirty-two largest cities in the world in the early 1990s twenty-two were located on estuaries 14 as ecosystems estuaries are under threat from human activities such as pollution and overfishing they are also threatened by sewage coastal settlement land clearance and much more estuaries are affected by events far upstream and concentrate materials such as pollutants and sediments 15 land run-off and industrial agricultural and domestic waste enter rivers and are discharged into estuaries contaminants can be introduced which do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment such as plastics pesticides furans dioxins phenols and heavy metals such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called bioaccumulation they also accumulate in benthic environments such as estuaries and bay muds a geological record of human activities of the last century the elemental composition of biofilm reflect areas of the estuary impacted by human activities and over time may shift the basic composition of the ecosystem and the reversible or irreversible changes in the abiotic and biotic parts of the systems from the bottom up 16 for example chinese and russian industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals has devastated fish stocks in the amur river and damaged its estuary soil 17 estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land runoff discharges nutrients into estuaries with human activities land run-off also now includes the many chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans excess oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones 18 this can result in reductions in water quality fish and other animal populations overfishing also occurs chesapeake bay once had a flourishing oyster population that has been almost wiped out by overfishing oysters filter these pollutants and either eat them or shape them into small packets that are deposited on the bottom where they are harmless historically the oysters filtered the estuary's entire water volume of excess nutrients every three or four days today that process takes almost a year 19 and sediment nutrients and algae can cause problems in local waters examples africa orange river estuary asia gulf of ob yenisei gulf europe the gironde golden horn the humber severn estuary
