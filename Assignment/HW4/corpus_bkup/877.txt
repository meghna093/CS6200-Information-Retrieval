america part of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season tropical storm larry was the twelfth tropical storm in the 2003 atlantic hurricane season it was one of eight storms to impact mexico from either the pacific or atlantic oceans in the season a near-record larry formed in early october from an extratropical storm in the bay of campeche and reached a peak intensity of 65 mph 100 km h due to weak steering currents the storm moved southward which resulted in the storm hitting the tabasco coastline the storm was the first tabascan landfall since tropical storm brenda in 1973.[1 larry drifted across the isthmus of tehuantepec dropping heavy rainfall of over 9 in 229 mm in places the rainfall led to flooding and mudslides causing damage to thousands of houses the flooding killed five people and resulted in 53.6 million 2003 usd in damage larry was one of three tropical cyclones to hit mexico in a short period of time including tropical depression nora and tropical storm olaf in the eastern pacific ocean meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 17 it moved across the shear-ridden atlantic ocean without development and remained disorganized until reaching the western caribbean sea on september 26 there the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop on the september 27 a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the yucatn peninsula the system continued to organize and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the yucatn peninsula on september 29.[2 dry air and land weakened the tropical wave and when it entered the area of the bay of campeche it merged with a stationary frontal boundary cool dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold core and the area organized into an extratropical low on september 30 a large high pressure system over the northern gulf of mexico forced the system southward where it developed significant convection the system developed a warm core and on october 1 the storm organized into tropical storm larry while located 300 mi 483 km east-southeast of tampico mexico 2 weak steering currents allowed for larry to drift westward at about two mph 3 km h while marginally favorable conditions allowed the storm to strengthen to a peak of 65 mph 105 km h on october 3 a mid-level ridge forced the storm more to the south-southeast where after remaining a 60 mph 97 km h storm for three days larry made landfall on paraso in the mexican state of tabasco on october 5 it steadily weakened over land and degenerated into a remnant low on october 6 while midway through the isthmus of tehuantepec the remnant low turned to the southwest and reached the eastern pacific ocean on the october 7.[2 the remnants of larry re-organized in the eastern pacific with the national hurricane center indicating for the possibility of redevelopment into a tropical depression on october 9.[3 however the convection diminished and further development was no longer anticipated 4 preparations due to its erratic motion the mexican government issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch early in larry's lifetime from veracruz to campeche the watches and warnings were extended westward to tuxpan on the 4th and extended eastward to ciudad del carmen on october 5.[2 due to the threat of the storm officials closed three pemex oil ports 5 the company used its reserves to make sure profits weren't disrupted 6 in addition the storm closed shipping ports in dos bocas in tabasco coatzacoalcos in veracruz and cayo arcas in campeche the mexican government placed six coastal states on maximum alert 5 while authorities set up 75 evacuation shelters for around 1,500 people because of the storm the government declared much of eastern mexico a state of emergency 7 impact rainfall totals from larry tropical storm larry was one of eight storms to hit mexico from either the atlantic ocean or the pacific ocean the highest since the record of nine in 1971.[8 the national hurricane center expected the storm to produce a storm surge of 3 to 5 feet 9 to 1.5 m with high waves on top 9 though no official surge readings were reported 2 the highest recorded winds on land were 59 mph 95 km h in el alacrn in tabasco the worst of larry's effects came from its rainfall peaking at 24.77 inches 629.2 mm in upper juarez in southeastern mexico 10 the highest 24-hour rainfall total was 9.6 inches 245.5 mm in tortuguero chiapas 8 while several other locations reported over 4 inches 102 mm in 24 hours 1 the

where over 9,000 houses were affected 12 the rainfall caused mudslides across the country hospitalizing two individuals in central hidalgo the flooding also caused severe crop damage along larry's path 13 strong wind gusts caused outages to telephone and power services 8 in all larry caused five deaths[2 and 53.6 million in damage 2003 usd 59 million 2005 usd 14 in el salvador rainfall from the
