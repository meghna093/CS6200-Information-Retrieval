especially affecting its surface and strongly implying severe weather it may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind tornados hail thunder and lightning a thunderstorm heavy precipitation snowstorm rainstorm heavy freezing rain ice storm strong winds tropical cyclone windstorm or wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere as in a dust storm blizzard sandstorm etc storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility lightning wildfires and vertical wind shear however systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise such as skiing and snowmobiling desert storms are often accompanied by violent winds and pass rapidly 1 the english word comes from proto-germanic sturmaz meaning noise tumult 2 lightning storm port-la-nouvelle formation satellite image of the intense nor'easter responsible for the north american blizzard of 2006 note the hurricane-like eye at the center storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with a system of high pressure surrounding it this combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as the cumulonimbus small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds types classic storm of summer in sierras de crdoba argentina there are many varieties and names for storms ice storm  ice storms are one of the most dangerous forms of winter storms when surface temperatures are below freezing but a thick layer of above-freezing air remains aloft rain can fall into the freezing layer and freeze upon impact into a glaze of ice in general 8 millimetres 0.31 in of accumulation is all that is required especially in combination with breezy conditions to start downing power lines as well as tree limbs 3 ice storms also make unheated road surfaces too slick to drive upon ice storms can vary in time range from hours to days and can cripple small towns and large urban centers alike blizzard  there are varying definitions for blizzards both over time and by location in general a blizzard is accompanied by gale-force winds heavy snow accumulating at a rate of at least 5 centimeters 2 in per hour and very cold conditions below approximately 10 degrees celsius or 14 f lately the temperature criterion has fallen out of the definition across the united states  [35 in other states all snow days must be made up 36 for example schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon shorten spring break or delay the start of summer vacation accumulated snow is removed to make travel easier and safer and to decrease the long-term effect of a heavy snowfall this process utilizes shovels and snowplows and is often assisted by sprinkling salt or other chloride-based chemicals which reduce the melting temperature of snow 37 in some areas with abundant snowfall such as yamagata prefecture japan people harvest snow and store it surrounded by insulation in ice houses this allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling methods 38 agriculture hail can cause serious damage notably to automobiles aircraft skylights glass-roofed structures livestock and most commonly farmers crops 39 wheat corn soybeans and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage 40 hail is one of canada's most expensive hazards 41 snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator conserving the heat of the earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring providing water for crop growth if it melts into water and refreezes upon sensitive crops such as oranges the resulting ice will protect the fruit from exposure to lower temperatures 42 although tropical cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions hurricanes in the eastern north pacific often supply moisture to the southwestern united states and parts of mexico 43 japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons 44 hurricane camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path 45 though it also killed 259 people and caused 9.14 billion 2005 usd in damage aviation effect of wind shear on aircraft trajectory merely correcting for the initial gust front can have dire consequences hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft 46 when hail stones exceed 0.5 inches 13 mm in diameter planes can be seriously damaged within seconds 47 the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft strong wind outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level initially this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear as the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft the localized headwind diminishes reducing the aircraft's airspeed and increasing its sink rate then when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft the headwind becomes a tailwind reducing lift generated by the wings and leaving the aircraft in a low-power low-speed descent this can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact as the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s in 1988 the u s federal aviation administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993 between 1964 and 1985 wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the u s that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries since 1995 the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of doppler weather radar units on the ground nexrad [48 recreation many winter sports such as skiing 49 snowboarding 50 snowmobiling 51 and snowshoeing depend upon snow where snow is scarce but the temperature is low enough snow cannons may be used to produce an adequate amount for such sports 52 children and adults can play on a sled or ride in a sleigh although a person's footsteps remain a visible lifeline within a snow-covered landscape snow cover is considered a general danger to hiking since the snow obscures landmarks and makes the landscape itself appear uniform 53 notable storms in art and culture the great wave off kanagawa a ukiyo-e print by hokusai in mythology and literature according to the bible a giant storm sent by god flooded the earth noah and his family and the animals entered the ark and the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights  the flood covered even the highest mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet and all creatures died only noah and those with him on the ark were left alive in the new testament jesus christ is recorded to have calmed a storm on the sea of galilee see also genesis flood myth the gilgamesh flood myth is a deluge story in the epic of gilgamesh in greek mythology there were several gods of storms briareos the god of sea storms aigaios a god of the violent sea storms and aiolos keeper of storm-winds squalls and tempests the sea venture was wrecked near bermuda in 1609 which led to the colonization of bermuda[54 and provided the inspiration for shakespeare's play the tempest 1611 55 specifically sir thomas gates future governor of virginia was on his way to england from jamestown virginia on saint james day while he was between cuba and the bahamas a hurricane raged for nearly two days though one of the small vessels in the fleet sank to the bottom of the florida straits seven of the remaining vessels reached virginia within several days after the storm the flagship of the fleet known as sea adventure disappeared and was presumed lost a small bit of fortune befell the ship and her crew when they made landfall on bermuda the vessel was damaged on a surrounding coral reef but all aboard survived for nearly a year on the island the british colonists claimed the island and quickly settled bermuda in may 1610 they set forth for jamestown this time arriving at their destination the children's novel the wonderful wizard of oz written by l frank baum and illustrated by w w denslow chronicles the adventures of a young girl named dorothy gale in the land of oz after being swept away from her kansas farm home by a tornado the story was originally published by the george m hill company in chicago on may 17 1900 and has since been reprinted numerous times most often under the name the wizard of oz and adapted for use in other media thanks in part to the 1939 mgm movie it is one of the best-known stories in american popular culture and has been widely translated its initial success and the success of the popular 1902 broadway musical which baum adapted from his original story led to baum's writing thirteen more oz books hollywood director king vidor february 8 1894  november 1 1982 survived the galveston hurricane of 1900 as a boy based on that experience he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone titled southern storm for the may 1935 issue of esquire magazine erik larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 2005 book isaac's storm 56 numerous other accounts of the galveston hurricane of 1900 have been made in print and in film larson cites many of them in isaac's storm which centrally features that storm as well as chronicles the creation of the weather bureau which came to known as the national weather service and that agency's fateful rivalry with the weather service in cuba and a number of other major storms such as those which ravaged indianola texas in 1875 and 1886.[56 the great storm of 1987 is key in an important scene near the end of possession a romance the bestselling and man booker prize-winning novel by a s byatt the great storm of 1987 occurred on the night of october 1516 1987 when an unusually strong weather system caused winds to hit much of southern england and northern france it was the worst storm to hit england since the great storm of 1703[57 284 years earlier and was responsible for the deaths of at least 22 people in england and france combined 18 in england at least four in france 58 hurricane katrina 2005 has been featured in a number of works of fiction in fine art rembrandt's the storm on the sea of galilee the romantic seascape painters j m w turner and ivan aivazovsky created some of the most lasting impressions of the sublime and stormy seas that are firmly imprinted on the popular mind turner's representations of powerful natural forces reinvented the traditional seascape during the first half of the nineteenth century upon his travels to holland he took note of the familiar large rolling waves of the english seashore transforming into the sharper choppy waves of a dutch storm a characteristic example of turners dramatic seascape is the slave ship of 1840 aivazovsky left several thousand turbulent canvases in which he increasingly eliminated human figures and historical background to focus on such essential elements as light sea and sky his grandiose ninth wave 1850 is an ode to human daring in the face of the elements in motion pictures the 1926 silent film the johnstown flood features the great flood of 1889 in johnstown pennsylvania the flood caused by the catastrophic failure of the south fork dam after days of extremely heavy rainfall prompted the first major disaster relief effort by the american red cross directed by clara barton the johnstown flood was depicted in numerous other media both fictional and in non-fiction as well warner bros  2000 dramatic disaster film the perfect storm directed by wolfgang petersen is an adaptation of sebastian junger's 1997
