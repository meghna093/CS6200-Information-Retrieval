time incorporated in 1961 as a book marketing division its name is derived from time and life magazines two of the most popular magazines of the era both of which were owned by the company it also was the holding company of television and radio combo stations klz-tv-am-fm in denver wfbm-tv-am-fm in indianapolis wood-tv-am in grand rapids michigan kero-tv in bakersfield california and kogo-tv-am-fm in san diego many of which were sold to mcgraw-hill in 1972 however time life kept wood-tv which became wotv after the sale of the other stations and remained owned by the company until 1984 time life was based in the time life building in rockefeller center time life gained fame as a seller of book series that would be mailed to households in monthly installments operating as book sales clubs several of these book series garnered substantial critical acclaim unusual for a mass-market mail order house citation needed for example the series library of photography of the early-1970s featured very high-quality duotone printing for its black-and-white reproductions in its original edition and was of course able to draw on life magazine's vast archive of journalistic and art photographs from virtually every major photographer foods of the world featured contributions by m f k fisher james beard julia child craig claiborne and many others and the good cook series edited by richard olney featured contributions from jeremiah tower jane grigson michel lemonnier and many others other series of high regard covered nature and the sciences as well as the history of world civilizations the science books are interesting as ephemera of their time the content of these series was more or less encyclopedic providing the basics of the subjects in the way it might be done in a lecture aimed at the general public there was also a series on contemporary life in various countries of the world some other series are much less highly regarded especially the later output as the publisher moved away from soberly presented science and history towards sensationalism pop-history and diy-themed books the books whatever their quality are easy to find at low prices on the used-book market due to their being published in the millions of copies some of the items in this list may also be single books not in a series but followed the same types of themes as the book series  yet of some series it is known that a particular title in the series enjoyed a much smaller print run than the other volumes in the series resulting the after-market value of that particular volume and or the set as a whole increasing examples include the fourteen volume 40th anniversary edition the civil war a narrative and the eighteen volume voices of the civil war series where the volumes petersburg siege to bentonville and shenandoah 1864 are the rarer ones respectively non-specific usa topic series were habitually translated in other languages french having been the more predominant one due to time life's desire to have neighboring french-canada served as well and disseminated through local branches of time-life books in the intended target markets however not rarely were these translated versions truncated for various reasons the dutch language versions  disseminated through time-life books international bv amsterdam the local branch for mainland europe at the time located at ottho heldringstraat 5 1066 az amsterdam netherlands  of history of the world as time life wereld geschiedenis the epic of flight as de geschiedenis van de luchtvaart and the enchanted world as het rijk der fabelen for example were shy of four seven and nine volumes respectively in translation whereas the german language version of the old west as der wilde westen and even though american specific translated nonetheless due to the continued popularity of the western genre in germany disseminated through the amsterdam branch as time-life bcher was shy of seven volumes of at least one book series

closed in 2003 time inc time warner however continues to publish similar material through time home entertainment inc music time life added music in 1967 selling box sets and collections through timelife records during the 1960s and 1970s the collections released by timelife records catered to a conservative adult audience with genres including classical jazz swing and orchestral music and the music of operas and broadway theatre on occasion time life offered popular music generally pre-1955 music as opposed to pop and rock music airing on contemporary hit radio stations in the united states at the time in box sets although there were television advertisements time life advertised most of these sets in magazines specialty catalogs and direct mail in the early 1980s time life began branching out offering a series of albums focusing on country music the first series was 1981's country music  with volumes focusing on a particular artist and featuring eight or nine tracks per album twenty volumes were issued with many of country's greatest artists of the time charley pride was the first artist featured getting their own album but until the mid-1980s timelife did not feature a rock music-intensive series for customers preferring to cater to older adults with conservative music tastes pop music enters the picture time life's first successful foray into rock music came in 1986 with a series called the rock n roll era  each volume in that serieslike similar series that followedfocused on a particular year in this case 1955 through 1964the early pre-beatles years of rock music a stylistic trend or particular artist influential in rock music each volume had 22 tracks and was said to contain the original hit recording by the original artist although this wasn't always true on early pressings of the early albums in the series the songs themselves represented the most important and popular songs from the period or subject featured an essay published by both sides now publications noted that time-life's move into rock music came at a time when much of the adult audience time-life catered to grew up during the rock-and-roll era and as such the new series was consistent with its goal of catering to an adult audience 4 the rock n roll era series was a big success and by the time the final volume was issued in the early 1990s more than 50 different volumes including two christmas albums had been released this paved the way for more country and pop music-intensive series including country usa  classic rock  sounds of the seventies  sounds of the eighties  your hit parade a series featuring popular music of the 1940s through early 1960s and super hits  like the earlier series each volume issued had its own paperback booklet containing liner notes and information about the songs with the addition of placement on various billboard magazine charts like the earlier box sets featuring other musical styles and genres the country and pop music series were advertised in magazines catalogs and direct mail by this time some of these collections were advertised on television either commercials or 30-minute infomercials the television advertisements used slogans e g relive your high school days  clips of songs included in each volume along with a scrolling list of other titles a commercial spokesman usually a performer or legendary disc jockey relevant to a given series such as rick dees for a 1970s-intensive collection and ralph emery for a country music series and testimonials from customers attesting to the quality and value of the albums to pitch a given series key selling points of these collections are that each track was digitally transferred to the desired format using the original master recordings as opposed to being re-records and that the most popular and requested songs by customers could be found in a single collection as opposed to a customer having to purchase many albums to obtain just a few desired tracks customers were given a choice of which format they wanted their box set either vinyl albums through 1990 8-track or cassette tape or compact disc today's box sets are offered only as compact discs while most of time life's box sets and releases were critically hailed there were also some minor faults pointed out by critics for instance several early pressings of the early volumes in the rock'n'roll era series contained stereo re-recordings of the original hits something that would be corrected on later pressings either with the correct original recording or a replacement track sometimes the most popular songs of a given time period were omitted frequently due to licensing issues examples included the beatles and the rolling stones for the classic rock and super hits   am gold series and prince madonna whitney houston and michael jackson on the main sounds of the eighties series through 2010 several different series time life had offered were available on a subscription basis either by calling a 1-800 number or sending a completed postcard-sized card and payment to timelife purportedly the customer would get a specific volume as advertised on tv or in a magazine first before receiving a new volume roughly every other month on the format of their choice customers and had the option of keeping just the volumes they wanted in time each volume was also offered for individual sale several of the series  especially the pop rock country and rhythm and blues series  had retail versions for sale released after the entire series was issued typically these were sold at discount stores often grouped in three-cd sets of 12 tracks each and having the most popular of the series tracks and cover artwork and naming loosely based off the subscription catalog-exclusive titles additionally the classic country series had special 15-track single-cd versions of several of its volumes issued for retail sale in addition to budget 3-cd sets saguaro road
