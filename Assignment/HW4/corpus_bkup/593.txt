the mainstream stalwarts 26 pluggedin's adam r holz comments on wade's proclamation of returning to a more innocent place for writing asserting that it didnt prevent lifehouse's latest from overflowing with the kind of mature perspective on life and love conflict and perseverance that no 17-year-old could ever articulate 29 johan wippsson writes for melodic net that firing squad and central park are top class where the band feels hungry and real again concluding that the album should be considered as one of the greatest in the genre 28 track listing all tracks produced by jason
