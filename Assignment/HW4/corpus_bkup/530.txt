with 95 octane avgas not the 100 octane fuel that the merlin xx was designed to use  soviet pilot nikolai g golodnikov remembered the hurricanes engine was powerful but it couldnt stand long periods of work at maximum regimes and would quickly break down the engine worked very clean it had exhaust stacks and flame suppressors mounted like mufflers n 9 this was very comfortable as the flames did not blind the pilot our planes were much worse in this respect but at negative g-forces the engine chocked there was no compensating tank this was very bad because we had to execute any manoeuvre with positive g-forces it had a very thick wing profile and poor acceleration characteristics it was not slow in responding to the control stick but everything happened smoothly slowly it had good lifting strength and was very good in horizontal manoeuvrability but the hurricane was very poor in vertical manoeuvre due to thick wing profile we mostly tried to impose a battle in the horizontal plane and would not go into a vertical one the hurricane burned rapidly  and to cinders like a match  as it had dural covering only on the tail and wings the rest was percale 116  malta the spitfire year 1942
