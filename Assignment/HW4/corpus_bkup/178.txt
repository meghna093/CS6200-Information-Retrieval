mechanical energy  wikipedia in the physical sciences mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy it is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object the principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to conservative forces the mechanical energy is constant if an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force the potential energy will increase and if the speed not the velocity of the object is changed the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well in all real systems however nonconservative forces like frictional forces will be present but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation in elastic collisions the mechanical energy is conserved but in inelastic collisions some mechanical energy is converted into heat the equivalence between lost mechanical energy dissipation and an increase in temperature was discovered by james prescott joule many devices are used to convert mechanical energy to or from other forms of energy e g an electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy an electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and a steam engine converts heat energy to mechanical energy general energy is a scalar quantity and the mechanical energy of a system is the sum of the potential energy which is measured by the position of the parts of the system the kinetic energy which is also called the energy of motion 1]            [7 citations bibliography brodie david brown wendy heslop nigel ireson gren williams peter 1998 terry parkin eds physics addison wesley longman limited isbn 978-0-582-28736-5 cs1 maint uses editors parameter link jain mahesh c 2009 textbook of engineering physics part i new delhi phi learning pvt ltd isbn 978-81-203-3862-3 retrieved 2011-08-25 newton isaac 1999 i bernard cohen anne miller whitman eds the principia mathematical principles of natural philosophy united states of america university of california press isbn 978-0-520-08816-0 cs1 maint uses editors parameter link v t e energy fundamental concepts energetics energy units energy system energy transformation mass massenergy equivalence power thermodynamics laws of thermodynamics exergy forms kinetic potential mechanical electric magnetic gravitational chemical ionization nuclear chromodynamic elastic mechanical wave sound wave radiant rest thermal energy carriers enthalpy fuel fossil fuel heat work electricity battery capacitor primary energy fossil fuel coal petroleum natural gas gravitational energy nuclear fuel natural uranium radiant energy solar wind bioenergy hydropower marine energy geothermal energy system components energy engineering oil refinery fossil-fuel power station cogeneration integrated gasification combined cycle nuclear power nuclear power plant radioisotope thermoelectric generator solar power photovoltaic system concentrated solar power solar thermal energy solar power tower solar furnace wind power wind farm high-altitude wind power hydropower hydroelectricity wave farm tidal power biomass geothermal power use and supply energy consumption world energy consumption energy security energy conservation efficient energy use transport agriculture renewable energy sustainable energy energy policy energy development worldwide energy supply south america usa mexico canada europe asia africa australia misc jevons's paradox carbon footprint
