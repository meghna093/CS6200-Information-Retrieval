relationship between cultural heritage tourism and a national identity in the case of the maya the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism by focusing on lifeways through costumes rituals diet handicrafts language housing or other features the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture 30 global tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods services and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change 31 estimated that between 35 and 40 percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples as well as sites and objects of global historical significance 32 in this production of tourism the use of historic symbols signs and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building 33 with this type of tourism people argue that ethno-commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds tourists travel with cultural expectations which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings 34 an example of this can be seen in mayanizing tourism on roatan island honduras archaeological perspectives on heritage development and indignity  alejandro j figueroa et al combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on roatan island honduras have become increasingly mayanized over the past decade as tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized maya past for the island non-maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed while heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups
