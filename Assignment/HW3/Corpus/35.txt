the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the earth's atmosphere known as thunder 1 thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus they are usually accompanied by strong winds heavy rain and sometimes snow sleet hail or in contrast no precipitation at all thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband known as a squall line strong or severe thunderstorms known as supercells rotate as do cyclones while most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction warm moist updraft from a thunderstorm associated with a southward-moving frontal boundary  taken from texarkana texas looking north thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm moist air sometimes along a front as the warm moist air moves upward it cools condenses and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20 kilometres 12 mi as the rising air reaches its dew point temperature water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the earth's surface as the droplets fall they collide with other droplets and become larger the falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it and this cold air spreads out at the earth's surface occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude where warm moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes 2 thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena thunderstorms and the phenomena that occur along with them pose great hazards damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds large hailstones and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts there are four types of thunderstorms single-cell multi-cell cluster multi-cell lines and supercells supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes dry thunderstorms with no precipitation can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them several means are used to study thunderstorms weather radar weather stations and video photography past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century beyond the earth's atmosphere thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of jupiter saturn neptune and probably venus life cycle stages of a thunderstorm's life see also cloud warm air has a lower density than cool air so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom              [86 frequent occurrences see also united states rainfall climatology a mild thunderstorm over niagara falls ontario thunderstorms occur throughout the world even in the polar regions with the greatest frequency in tropical rainforest areas where they may occur nearly daily at any given time approximately 2,000 thunderstorms are occurring on earth 87 kampala and tororo in uganda have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on earth 88 a claim also made for singapore and bogor on the indonesian island of java other cities known for frequent storm activity include darwin caracas manila and mumbai thunderstorms are associated with the various monsoon seasons around the globe and they populate the rainbands of tropical cyclones 89 in temperate regions they are most frequent in spring and summer although they can occur along or ahead of cold fronts at any time of year 90 they may also occur within a cooler air mass following the passage of a cold front over a relatively warmer body of water thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures some of the most powerful thunderstorms over the united states occur in the midwest and the southern states these storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the west coast of the united states 91 but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas particularly the sacramento and san joaquin valleys of california in spring and summer they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the rocky mountains as part of the north american monsoon regime in the northeast storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the midwest but with less frequency and severity during the summer air-mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of florida types of lightning play media 3-second video of a lightning strike within a thunderstorm over island in the sky canyonlands national park utah cloud to ground lightning over pentagon city in arlington virginia lightning storm over sydney main article lightning lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs in a thunderstorm it can be seen in the form of a bright streak or bolt from the sky lightning occurs when an electrical charge is built up within a cloud due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level when a large enough charge is built up a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning the temperature of a lightning bolt can be five times hotter than the surface of the sun 92 although the lightning is extremely hot the duration is short and 90 of strike victims survive contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot some people have been struck by lightning over three times and skyscrapers like the empire state building have been struck numerous times in the same storm 93 the loud bang that is heard is the super heated air around the lightning bolt expanding at the speed of sound because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is seen before the bang although both occur at the same moment there are several types of lightning in-cloud lightning is the most common it is lightning within a cloud and is sometimes called intra-cloud or sheet lightning cloud to ground lightning is when a bolt of lightning from a cloud strikes the ground this form poses the greatest threat to life and property ground to cloud lightning is when a lightning bolt is induced from the ground to the cloud cloud to cloud lightning is rarely seen and is when a bolt of lightning arcs from one cloud to another ball lightning is extremely rare and has several hypothesized explanations it is seen in the form of a 15 to 50 centimeter radius ball 94 cloud to air lightning is when lightning from a cloud hits air of a different charge 95 dry lightning is a misnomer that refers to a thunderstorm whose precipitation does not reach the ground heat lightning refers to a lightning flash that is seen from the horizon that does not have accompanying thunder 96 upper-atmospheric lightning occurs above the thunderhead clear-air lightning is used widely to describe lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it in the u s and canadian rockies a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not be observable either visually or audibly from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes european and asian mountainous areas experience similar events also in clear areas where the storm cell is on the near horizon within 26 km 16 mi a strike can occur and as the storm is so far away the strike is referred to as clear-air citation needed energy see also sprite lightning upper-atmospheric lightning and st elmo's fire how thunderstorms launch particle beams into space if the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated in a typical thunderstorm approximately 5108 kg of water vapor are lifted and the amount of energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules this is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at hiroshima japan in 1945.[10 the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor results show that gamma rays and antimatter particles positrons can be generated in powerful thunderstorms 97 it is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes tgf tgfs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning the streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays 98 about 500 tgfs may occur every day worldwide but mostly go undetected studies in more contemporary times thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity every spring storm chasers head to the great plains of the united states and the canadian prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of videotaping 99 radio pulses produced by cosmic rays are being used to study how electric charges develop within thunderstorms 100 more organized meteorological projects such as vortex2 use an array of sensors such as the doppler on wheels vehicles with mounted automated weather stations weather balloons and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe weather 101 lightning is detected remotely using sensors that detect cloud-to-ground lightning strokes with 95 percent accuracy in detection and within 250 metres 820 ft of their point of origin 102 mythology and religion thunderstorms strongly influenced many early civilizations greeks believed that they were battles waged by zeus who hurled lightning bolts forged by hephaestus some american indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the thunderbird who they believed was a servant of the great spirit 103 the norse considered thunderstorms to occur when thor went to fight jtnar with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer mjlnir hinduism recognizes indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms christian doctrine accepted the ideas of aristotle's original work called meteorologica that winds were caused by exhalations from the earth and that fierce storms were the work of god these ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century 104 martin luther was out walking when a thunderstorm began causing him to pray to god for being saved and promising to become a monk 105 outside of earth thunderstorms evidenced by flashes of lightning on jupiter have been detected and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice suggesting that a similar mechanism may act as on earth water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning 106 these electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on the earth 107 the water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior 108 the clouds of venus may also be capable of producing lightning some observations suggest that the lightning rate is at least half of that on earth 109 see also
