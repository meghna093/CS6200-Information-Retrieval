rica panama as joan el salvador guatemala mexico as miriam nicaragua as both part of the 1988 atlantic and pacific hurricane seasons hurricane joan was a powerful hurricane that caused death and destruction in over a dozen countries in the caribbean and central america moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in october 1988 hurricane joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into central america widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by joan primarily across nicaragua as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane's path after crossing central america into the pacific the cyclone was renamed tropical storm miriam with the system's dissipation occurring southwest of mexico joanmiriam was the final hurricane of the 1988 atlantic hurricane season and the final named storm of the pacific hurricane season 1]   [7 joan made landfall just south of bluefields on october 22.[7 it passed over the northern portion of lake nicaragua passed over managua and entered the pacific ocean near leon on october 23.[2 joan remained a hurricane or tropical storm during its entire passage over central america and was a minimal tropical storm when it reached the pacific 2 as per the policy at the time joan was renamed miriam 2 tropical storm miriam hugged the coast of central america and reached its peak of 986 millibars on october 24.[8 ordinarily a pressure this low would indicate a category 1 hurricane but due to its disorganized convection miriam was not upgraded to a hurricane 8 land interaction and wind shear weakened miriam to a tropical depression on october 26 low-level winds carried the system out to sea and its convection dissipated on october 28.[8 miriam's remnants continued out to sea and they regenerated on october 30 the tropical depression hung on for the next few days until its second and final dissipation on november 2.[9 unusual path hurricane joan's path through the southern caribbean in late october was highly unusual most october storms in the atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the caribbean and often recurve quickly 10 joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a june system in 1933 although hurricane irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of joan's 5 joan-miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage from the atlantic to pacific ocean only seven other storms have been known to survive the passage between the atlantic and pacific oceans 11 preparations tropical storm miriam on october 23 tropical storm watches and later warnings were issued for the windward islands as far north as martinique on october 13 they were dropped over the subsequent two days as joan passed through along the coast of south america additional warnings were raised and later dropped as joan paralleled the coast 12 the first hurricane watches were issued for parts of panama and providencia starting on october 18 the watch area was expanded to include costa rica and nicaragua on october 19 as the watches were upgraded to warnings these warnings provided several hours worth of lead time allowing evacuations and preparations to be made 13 in addition flash flood and mudslide warnings were issued for western panama costa rica honduras and nicaragua starting on october 21 in response to miriam the flood and mudslide warnings issued because of joan were not lifted until october 23 and 25 tropical storm warnings were issued for the pacific coast of nicaragua el salvador and the gulf of fonseca on october 24 they were dropped the next day guatemala was placed under a warning on october 24 in addition new flash flood and mudslide warnings were raised for guatemala and the mexican state of chiapas on october 24 and 25 respectively all warnings and watches were discontinued later on october 25 as miriam turned away from the coast 14 despite the dangers from the intense hurricane evacuations in bluefields were met with resistance and disbelief from residents 3 in managua 70,000 people were evacuated to safe areas 2 in the remaining areas of nicaragua 300,000 people were evacuated 15 in costa rica a total of 55,000 people were evacuated 16 impact hurricane joan killed at least 216 people with 118 unaccounted for the total cost of damage was around 2 billion 1988 usd 1 all of the deaths and most of the damage were due to the joan portion of hurricane joanmiriam 9 lesser antilles no casualties were reported in the windward islands including grenada where on october 15 joan made landfall 3 passing just south joan brought rough seas and winds of 40 mph 65 km h with gusts to 55 mph 90 km h to the islands of aruba bonaire and curaao on october 16 damaging coastal facilities and roofs structural damage from the storm was estimated at 1.5 million 1988 usd increased moisture in joan's wake caused persistent rainfall on the islands for several days leading to widespread flooding 17 in trinidad and tobago joan was described as a minor inconvenience 18 sustained winds up to 51 mph 82 km h with gusts up to 64 mph 103 km h were recorded on grenada heavy rains amounted to 6 in 152.4 mm in st george's significant flooding was reported throughout the island resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage 19 a rare invasion of african desert locusts in the windward islands were blamed on the storm 20 south america in venezuela 11 people were killed due to flash-flooding caused by heavy rains landslides and flooding killed 25 people in colombia the rains and flooding left 27,000 people homeless 3 throughout colombia damages amounted to 1 billion 21 nicaragua most of the destruction was in nicaragua throughout the country 148 people perished 184 were badly hurt and 100 were unaccounted for roughly 23,300 homes were destroyed with 6,000 being damaged 2 many settlements on the atlantic coast of the country were completely destroyed 15 the national electric company had 620 miles 1,000 km of downed power lines at the cost of 2.5 million usd 1988 dollars 22 a port being constructed with bulgarian help at el bluff was severely damaged on a brighter note public health measures managed to keep the death toll lower than it could have been 15 bluefields was hit with extreme impact almost all of the 7,500 structures in the city were demolished[19 or had their roofs blown off the majority of the main buildings in the city were destroyed 2 the hurricane also wreaked havoc on agriculture in the country around 15,700 head of cattle 20,000 pigs and 456,000 chickens were killed 2 the hurricane caused severe disruption in most of nicaragua's remaining rain forests in the areas it hit and also stripped trees of leaves 23 in the southeast rain forests joan toppled or snapped 80 percent of the trees and completely destroyed 500,000 hectares 1,200,000 acres of canopy 24 hurricane joan caused transportation difficulties in the country floodwaters destroyed 30 bridges and seriously damaged 36 others roads totaling 404 miles 650 km in length were washed away 2 in an unfortunate coincidence hurricane joan hit shortly after an armed conflict in the region had started to cool off the hurricane destroyed much of the infrastructure in nicaragua contributing to a recession that was already underway the losses to cash crops severely reduced exports to under 200 million dollars 1988 usd 22 these factors combined to aggravate a recession and deepen the economic crisis government spending to rebuild infrastructure negated recently introduced anti-inflation measures hurricane joan was a partial cause of nicaraguans being on average worse-off than they were in the 1970s 25 in all the storm left at least 250,000 people homeless 26 total damages in the country amounted to 751.1 million 21 joan was the first major hurricane to strike nicaragua since edith in 1971 joan-miriam's rainfall in mexico rest of central america in costa rica 28 people were

rainfall locally exceeding 300 millimetres 12 in was reported these rains caused flooding and landslides especially in mountainous regions 2 those heavy rains caused seven deaths in panama and left 60 million in damages 28 mexico in mexico heavy rainfall associated with tropical storm miriam caused the cancellation of flights from the airport at tuxtla gutirrez the highest rainfall reported recorded was 10.37 inches 263 mm at lazaro cardenas 29 in small settlements rivers were flooded and mudslides were reported casualties from the flooding are not known 9 aftermath the response to requests for international aid was moderate american church groups cuba and mexico collectively contributed around 2,500 tons of food and medicine the canadian swedish west german spanish and dutch governments contributed aid amounting to 2 million dollars 1988 each no aid was sent by the united states government the soviet union contributed an unknown sum 22 the slow response to requests for aid was contributed to by the sandinista government's actions which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press as undermining the peace process championed by scar arias 22 those actions were the july 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations 22 in addition the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving american aid as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm 22 on october 28 1988 the united nations general assembly passed without a vote resolution 17 of its 43rd session in response to the disaster the resolution called on countries to contribute to the relief effort 30 retirement see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names the name joan was retired in
