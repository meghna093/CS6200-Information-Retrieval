treaties book category v t e a nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions either fission fission bomb or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions thermonuclear bomb both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter the first test of a fission atomic bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of tnt 84 tj the first thermonuclear hydrogen bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of tnt 42 pj 1 a thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds 1,100 kg can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of tnt 5.0 pj 2 a nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast fire and radiation since they are weapons of mass destruction the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy nuclear weapons have been used twice in war both times by the united states against japan near the end of world war ii on august 6 1945 the u s army air forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed little boy over the japanese city of hiroshima three days later on august 9 the u s army air forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed fat man over the japanese city of nagasaki these bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel from injuries sustained from the explosions 3 the ethics of these bombings and their role in japan's surrender are subjects of debate since the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration only a few nations possess such weapons or are suspected of seeking them the only countries known to have detonated nuclear weaponsand acknowledge possessing themare chronologically by date of first test the united states the soviet union succeeded as a nuclear power by russia the united kingdom france china india pakistan and north korea israel is believed to possess nuclear weapons though in a policy of deliberate ambiguity it does not acknowledge having them germany italy turkey belgium and the netherlands are nuclear weapons sharing states 4]                   [88 the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty of 1996 once it enters into force will prohibit
