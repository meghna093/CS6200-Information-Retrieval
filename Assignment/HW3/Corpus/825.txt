islands especially antigua and barbuda guadeloupe st kitts and nevis sint eustatius saba st barthelemy st martin and anguilla puerto rico bermuda parts of the northeastern usa newfoundland part of the 1995 atlantic hurricane season hurricane luis was a long-lived and an extremely destructive cape verde-type hurricane as well as one of the strongest deadliest and most notable hurricanes of the 1995 atlantic hurricane season with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph 220 km h luis was also the strongest hurricane to make landfall and the third-most intense hurricane recorded during the extremely active season the storm was the twelfth tropical storm sixth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season at one point the storm was one of four simultaneous tropical systems in the atlantic basin along with humberto iris and karen the storm lasted for 14 days as a tropical storm between late august and nearly middle september the system initially formed from a tropical wave south of cape verde islands west of africa on august 27 then subsequently attained tropical storm status on august 29 two days later that day the storm reached hurricane status shortly thereafter it rapidly strengthened into a 140 mph 220 km h category 4 hurricane 1 at this strength it affected much of the leeward islands on september 4 to september 6 throughout the following days luis gradually weakened as it accelerated safely to the west of bermuda as a category 1 hurricane luis made landfall on newfoundland before it became extratropical on september 11 it caused catastrophic damage in antigua barbuda st barthelemy st martin and anguilla as a category 4 with winds of 130 mph 209 km h the storm accounted for 19 deaths left between 20,000 and 70,000 homeless mostly in antigua barbuda and saint martin and caused roughly 3 billion 1995 usd in damage across the affected areas hurricane luis was the most devastating hurricane to strike the northern leeward islands in the 20th century and one of the strongest storms to hit the leeward islands at the time along with hurricane david in 1979 and hurricane hugo in 1989 additionally luis was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect guadeloupe in a short period of time the first being hurricane iris a week before and the last being hurricane marilyn only ten days afterward the next year the leeward islands would be struck by hurricane bertha while still repairing from luis and marilyn then successively hit by hortense erika georges jose lenny and debby luis was also responsible for an intense rogue wave which struck rms queen elizabeth 2 on monday september 11 though the ship pulled through with little damage meteorological history main article meteorological history of hurricane luis map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale the origins of hurricane luis trace back to an area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave over the eastern atlantic ocean on august 26 a low-level circulation center formed and moved westward until it developed a weak surface low on august 27 consequently a tropical depression was designated at 1200 utc that day the depression attained 36 hours later into a tropical storm named luis on august 29 though convective activity fluctuated for the next two days as a result of nearby wind shear the storm slowly intensified while pressure rose the shear relented the next day allowing an eye to gradually form and the system attained hurricane status thereafter on early august 31 then a category 3 major hurricane 18 hours later 1 hurricane luis continued to strengthen as it tracked west-northwestward into a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale on september 2 and the cyclone turned more towards the west earlier that day as it maintained a rectilinear slow motion on september 3 a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the storm that reached category 4 status earlier peaked with 140 mph 230 km h and maintained it for two days and a half at this time it was located approximately 540 miles 870 km to the east of the lesser antilles as a result the storm began to slightly accelerate as it moved along a subtropical ridge due to the absorption of karen by the stronger iris 1 by the day of september 4 luis sustained a large wind field as it approach the lesser antilles its tropical storm-force winds measured from 345 mi 555 km to 365 mi 587 km in diameter as it begin to affected in the night antigua barbuda dominica and guadeloupe on the morning of september 5 islands such as dominica and even the islands of guadeloupe where it experienced hurricane-force winds on the northeastern coast of grande-terre and dsirade has been relatively spared by the storm however the eyewall of the hurricane skimed antigua and directly passing over barbuda while weakened slightly during the time it proceeded slowly northwestward affecting montserrat saint kitts and nevis sint eustatius and saba causing moderate damage later luis moved along st barthelemy st martin and ultimately crossed anguilla where maximum sustained winds within the eyewall were estimated to have reached 135 mph 217 km h and its central pressure had dropped from 945 to 942 mbar 27.9 to 27.8 inhg 1 a large and powerful hurricane luis retained category 4 intensity until september 7 situated about 150 mi 240 km to the north of puerto rico the storm gradually re-curved over the northern atlantic as a category 2 after having spent 7 consecutive days as a major hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 115 mph 185 km h from september 1 to 8 from there on the center of the storm passed 200 miles 320 km to the west of bermuda on september 9 causing minor damage and then later weakened to a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph 165 km h 2 several hours later the hurricane made its closest approach to bermuda passing about 200 mi 320 km west of the island 1 later that day the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of luis 3 during the afternoon of september 10 hurricane luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the canadian coastline 4 due to the rapid movement of the storm significant weakening did not occur until luis was at an unusually high latitude as the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961 mbar 28.38 inhg but sustained winds did not exceed 90 mph 140 km h according to the nhc 1]      [37 at about the same time a nearby canadian buoy recorded a 98-foot wave 30 m 1 though the ship did not sustain any significant damage its arrival in new york was delayed considerably 38 atlantic canada hurricane luis making landfall in canada throughout eastern newfoundland the system dropped 2.4 to 4.7 inches 61 to 119 mm of rain at its landfall as a category 1.[39 northwesterly winds there gusted to 81 mph 130 km h 4 the storm caused minor damage to the large province one

winds and seas possible explanation for the storm's heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations and their houses 1 another factual reason was substantial difference in wind speed forecasts measured at sea-level princess juliana airport on the dutch side and those measured on homes throughout the island hillsides  broadcast from sites off the island sea-level airport readings showed 86 mph 139 km h sustained winds and winds gusting to 114 mph 183 km h 21 whereas measurements on some hillside homes and especially the airport on the north of the french side between two mountains showed wind gusts between 170 and 205 mph 275 and 330 km h an sailor that been sheltered in the lagoon recorded a 115 mph 185 km h winds gusting and a minimal pressure reading to 965 mbar 28.5 inhg 42 records and retirement see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names a satellite image of the atlantic ocean on august 24 including humberto iris jerry and two waves that would soon become karen and luis when tropical depression thirteen strengthened into tropical storm luis on august 29 it marked the earliest date on which the twelfth named storm of any season formed surpassing the previous record set by tropical storm twelve of the 1933 season shortly before becoming extratropical hurricane luis was moving at 65 mph 105 km h becoming one of the fastest moving atlantic hurricanes in recorded history 43 on september 11 a 98 feet 30 m wave struck an ocean liner this wave is the largest wave ever recorded 44 however hurricane ivan in 2004 may have produced a wave up to 130 feet 40 m high off the coast of mexico 45 since 1950 there have been very few atlantic hurricanes that have had an accumulated cyclone energy ace index over 50 as it spent nearly fourteen days as a named storm luis achieved and ace value of 53.5 which was the highest since inez in 1966 and remained the highest until being surpassed by hurricanes isabel in 2003 ivan in 2004 and irma in 2017 due to the severe damage and loss of life caused by the storm in the leeward islands the name luis was retired in the spring of 1996 and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with lorenzo in the 2001 season luis was the first atlantic hurricane name beginning with l and the first hurricane to be retired in three years since hurricane andrew in 1992.[46 see
