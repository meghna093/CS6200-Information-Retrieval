electricity to neighbouring systems in canada and the united states under long term contracts and transactions on the new england new york and ontario bulk energy markets two subsidiaries hq energy marketing and hq energy services u s  are engaged in the electricity trade on behalf of the company in 2010 export sales of electricity brought in 1,513 million for a transaction volume of 23.3 twh despite exceptionally low runoff according to the company net exports accounted for a net income of 1,034 million and a net reservoir drawdown of 12.5 twh 152 although most export sales are now short-term transactions hydro-qubec has entered into long-term export contracts in the past in 1990 the company signed a 328-mw deal with a group of 13 electric distributors in vermont exports from hydro-qubec account for 28 of all power used in the state 153 on march 11 2010 vermont's two largest utilities green mountain power and central vermont public service entered into a tentative 26-year deal with hydro-qubec to purchase up to 225 mw of hydro power from 2012 to 2038 the memorandum of understanding provides for a price smoothing mechanism shielding vermont customers from market price spikes the deal is contingent upon the enactment designating large hydro as renewable energy 154 the renewable energy law h.781,[155 was adopted by both houses of the legislature and signed into law by governor jim douglas on june 4 2010.[156 a second contract has been signed with cornwall electric a subsidiary of fortis inc a utility serving 23,000 customers in the cornwall ontario area the contract was renewed in 2008 and will be in force until 2019.[157 the company has several advantages in its dealings in export markets first its costs are not affected by the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices since hydropower requires no fuel also hydro-qubec has a lot of flexibility in matching supply and demand so it can sell electricity at higher prices during the day and replenish its reservoirs at night when wholesale prices are lower third the quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating unlike most neighboring systems where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer due to the air conditioning needs of homes and offices 158 the election of barack obamaa supporter of renewable energy greenhouse gas emissions trading and the development of electric carsas president of the united states in 2008 was seen as a positive development for the company's outlook despite the success of the previous policy of short-term sales on neighboring energy markets the quebec government asked hydro-qubec management to write a new strategic plan focusing on long-term sale agreements with us distributors as was the case after the commissioning of the james bay project
