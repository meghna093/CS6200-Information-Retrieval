a new record for the highest amount of tornadoes produced by a tropical cyclone due to its slow movement over texas beulah led to significant flooding at the time beulah ranked as the second-costliest hurricane on record having left roughly 1 billion 1967 usd in damage only hurricane betsy two years prior had caused such considerable losses throughout its path at least 59 people were killed meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale on august 22 1967 an essa-5 satellite image depicted an area of enhanced convectionshower and thunderstorm activityeast of the western high plateau in cameroon over central africa reaching the western slopes of the mountains two days later the tropical wave became more coherent with clouds condensing along its axis as it moved over west africa cyclonic rotation became apparent about 2,000 ft 610 m above the surface a research paper published in 1969 refers to the disturbance as a depression as it neared the west coast of africa 1 however this significantly differs from the official atlantic hurricane database which does not mention the system at that time 2 as a surface circulation likely did not exist regardless the system emerged over the atlantic ocean around 12n on august 28 as represented by barometric pressure falls in dakar senegal 1 once over water the system interacted with the intertropical convergence zone and continued westward along an undulating path with no further organization it was not until a united states navy weather reconnaissance plane flew into the disturbance on september 4 while it was located east of the lesser antilles that signs of development were apparent corresponding observations from ships in the region on september 5 confirmed the existence of a 1010 mbar hpa 28.23 inhg low-pressure area 3 in light of this the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression at 12:00 utc that day with its center situated roughly 175 mi 285 km east-northeast of barbados 2 a slow-moving system the depression steadily organized as it approached the lesser antilles observations from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that the system attained gale-force winds by 12:00 utc on september 7 resulting in its upgrade to a tropical storm it was also assigned the name beulah making it the second named storm of the 1967 season shortly after being named beulah clipped the southern coast of martinique and entered the eastern caribbean sea feeding off the warm waters of the caribbean the cyclone quickly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity by 18:00 utc on september 8 rapid deepening ensued thereafter with the storm's central pressure falling to 940 mbar hpa 27.75 inhg the following day as it passed 100 mi 160 km south of puerto rico 3 at this time winds were estimated to be at least 140 mph 225 km h ranking beulah as a category 4 on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale 2 upon reaching this strength weather radar imagery from san juan puerto rico showed that beulah featured a 15 mi 24 km wide eye surrounded by an intense eyewall about 8 mi 13 km thick 4 during the evening of september 9 beulah turned westward as weak ridge developed over the bahamas between it and the newly formed tropical storm doria 3 the powerful storm weakened somewhat as an eyewall replacement cycle began to take shape during this phase the inner-eye of beulah contracted to roughly 34 mi 56 km in diameter while a second eyewall spanned an area 28 mi 45 km across the smaller eye soon dissipated and the larger one became the single dominant feature by the morning of september 10 the completion of this marked the first time that an eyewall replacement cycle was observed in its entirety 4 the aforementioned westward turn placed the dominican republic in the line of danger an area still reeling from the devastating effects of hurricane inez just one year prior fortunately the storm unexpectedly collapsed as it approached the barahona peninsula and struck the area as a greatly weakened though still significant hurricane with estimated winds of 90 mph 150 km h around 18:00 utc on september 11.      [10 across the island nearly 1,000 residents were left homeless including 400 in fort-de-france 11 damage on the island amounted to 4.5 million 3 supplies of fresh water were severely limited for two days following the storm 11 heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides across st vincent blocking numerous roads and causing some damage two children were killed after a boulder dislodged by the rains crashed into their home 12 damage on st lucia reached 3 million mainly stemming from the banana crop which was largely ruined 3 the periphery of the hurricane brought rainfall primarily to southwestern puerto rico where a maximum of 9.76 inches 248 mm fell at maricao 13 one person lost their life on the island and damage was a minimal 150,000.[3 owing to effective evacuations only two people lost their lives in the dominican republic the core of beulah impacted areas devastated by hurricane inez a year prior and left extensive damage in its wake 3 early reports indicated that more than 1,000 people were left homeless across the barahona peninsula 14 flash flooding affected the southern coasts of both the dominican republic and haiti 15 beulah had limited impact on jamaica as it brushed the island as a weak tropical storm 3 according to newspapers gale-force winds affected the nation though there were no reports of damage 16 mexico rainfall from hurricane beulah across mexico

sensitive ecosystem was altered by the storm the highest sustained wind was reported as 136 miles per hour 219 km h recorded in the town of south padre island across the laguna madre from port isabel winds as high as 109 miles per hour 175 km h were measured at the brownsville national weather service office at landfall since the hurricane bent the anemometer 30 degrees from the vertical it is possible the winds at brownsville were underestimated 23 gusts of over 100 miles per hour 160 km h were recorded as far inland as the towns of mcallen edinburg mission and pharr some 50 miles 80 km from the gulf coast beulah spawned a record 115 tornadoes[24 which destroyed homes commercial property and inflicted serious damage on the region's agricultural industry the tornado record from beulah

various ways to survive ants survived the floods by congregating in spheres of living colonies and floated down streams to safety predaceous beetle larvae preyed on frogs and rodents crustaceans from the beaches migrated en masse to the protection of high ground 27 hurricane beulah caused an estimated us 1.41 billion 2010 dollars in damage sources report 15 total deaths from the storm 28 aftermath across the yucatan peninsula the government of mexico set up an air lift of food and medical supplies to isolated areas by september 18.[18 the name beulah was retired and will never be used for an
