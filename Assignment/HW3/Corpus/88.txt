of earth's oceanic divisions it extends from the arctic ocean in the north to the southern ocean or depending on definition to antarctica in the south and is bounded by asia and australia in the west and the americas in the east at 165,250,000 square kilometers 63,800,000 square miles in area as defined with an antarctic southern border this largest division of the world oceanand in turn the hydrospherecovers about 46 of earth's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area making it larger than all of earth's land area combined 1 both the center of the water hemisphere and the western hemisphere are in the pacific ocean the equator subdivides it into the north pacific ocean and south pacific ocean with two exceptions the galpagos and gilbert islands while straddling the equator are deemed wholly within the south pacific 2 its mean depth is 4,280 meters 14,040 feet the mariana trench in the western north pacific is the deepest point in the world reaching a depth of 10,911 meters 35,797 feet 3 the western pacific has many peripheral seas though the peoples of asia and oceania have traveled the pacific ocean since prehistoric times the eastern pacific was first sighted by europeans in the early 16th century when spanish explorer vasco nez de balboa crossed the isthmus of panama in 1513 and discovered the great southern sea which he named mar del sur in spanish the ocean's current name was coined by portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan during the spanish circumnavigation of the world in 1521 as he encountered favorable winds on reaching the ocean he called it mar pacfico which in both portuguese and spanish means peaceful sea 4 history early migrations this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it october 2017 made in 1529 the diogo ribeiro map was the first to show the pacific at about its proper size maris pacifici by ortelius 1589 one of the first printed maps to show the pacific ocean   p53 by 1900 nearly all pacific islands were in control of britain france united states germany japan and chile 23 although the united states gained control of guam and the philippines from spain in 1898,      [64 the dissimilarity continues northeastward along the western edge of the andes cordillera along south america to mexico returning then to the islands off california indonesia the philippines japan new guinea and new zealand lie outside the andesite line within the closed loop of the andesite line are most of the deep troughs submerged volcanic mountains and oceanic volcanic islands that characterize the pacific basin here basaltic lavas gently flow out of rifts to build huge dome-shaped volcanic mountains whose eroded summits form island arcs chains and clusters outside the andesite line volcanism is of the explosive type and the pacific ring of fire is the world's foremost belt of explosive volcanism 40 the ring of fire is named after the several hundred active volcanoes that sit above the various subduction zones the pacific ocean is the only ocean which is almost totally bounded by subduction zones only the antarctic and australian coasts have no nearby subduction zones geological history the pacific ocean was born 750 million years ago at the breakup of rodinia although it is generally called the panthalassic ocean until the breakup of pangea about 200 million years ago 65 the oldest pacific ocean floor is only around 180 ma old with older crust subducted by now 66 seamount chains the pacific ocean contains several long seamount chains formed by hotspot volcanism these include the hawaiianemperor seamount chain and the louisville ridge economy the exploitation of the pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths in shallow waters of the continental shelves off the coasts of australia and new zealand petroleum and natural gas are extracted and pearls are harvested along the coasts of australia japan papua new guinea nicaragua panama and the philippines although in sharply declining volume in some cases 67 fishing fish are an important economic asset in the pacific the shallower shoreline waters of the continents and the more temperate islands yield herring salmon sardines snapper swordfish and tuna as well as shellfish 68 overfishing has become a serious problem in some areas for example catches in the rich fishing grounds of the okhotsk sea off the russian coast have been reduced by at least half since the 1990s as a result of overfishing 69 environmental issues main article marine pollution see also great pacific garbage patch and environmental impact of shipping marine debris on a hawaiian coast the quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east pacific ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.[70 marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles the main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste 71 the rivers then empty into the ocean often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone 72 marine debris also known as marine litter is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake sea ocean or waterway oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter 71 in addition the pacific ocean has served as the crash site of satellites including mars 96 fobos-grunt and upper atmosphere research satellite
