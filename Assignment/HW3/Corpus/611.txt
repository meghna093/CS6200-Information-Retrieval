franchise-low 171 goals allowing 358 goals and earned notoriety by losing two games by a combined score of 220 the first humiliation was a 100 loss to the vancouver giants on january 24 2014 followed by a 120 loss to the edmonton oil kings on february 17 the team capped off the season on a 15-game losing streak finishing the year at 125523 with 29 points the league's lowest point total placing them in last place in the entire whl the 12 wins and 29 points also set records for fewest wins and fewest points in the 26-year history of the lethbridge hurricanes and the 46-year history of the franchise that began as the winnipeg jets in recent years the community-owned franchise has faced serious financial problems which came to light during the 201314 season the team lost upwards of 1.25 million in a two-year period[7 and has gone as far as having to scale back on their marketing campaigns and player accommodations on road trips in march 2014 the team revealed it had to take out a line of credit in order to meet financial goals 8 the financial situation of the team has led to internet rumours of the team possibly being sold to true north sports and entertainment and relocated to winnipeg 9 while former hurricanes forward and lethbridge native kris versteeg has publicly stated his desire to purchase the team and keep it in the city 10 as the losses continued to pile up and the fan interest waning the team fired head coach drake berehowsky on december 9 and general manager brad robson on december 10 and hired former prince albert raiders head coach peter anholt to both positions that day anholt stepped down as coach but stayed on as general manager and hired 33 year old brent kisio away from the calgary hitmen as the team's new head coach season-by-season record
