and will utilize the fss for providing crew access for the dragon v2 launches 64 launch vehicles will be assembled horizontally in a hangar near the pad transferred to the pad and then lifted atop a launch platform for the remainder of the launch prep and lift off 56 for military missions from pad 39a payloads will be vertically integrated as that is required per launch contract with the us air force 56 a hammerhead crane is planned to be added to the fss in order to support us military requirements for vertical payload integration 64 pad 39a will be used to host launches of astronauts on the crewed-version of the dragon space capsule in a publicprivate partnership with nasa the nasa plan as of april 2014   [needs update in march 2015 pad 39b was undergoing modifications to the catacomb roof structure so that it can handle the loads from the sls block 1b rocket increasing the load capacity to support the crawler-transporter and vertical rocket from 21,000,000 to 25,500,000 pounds 9,500,000 to 11,600,000 kg 67 in 2014 nasa announced that it would make pad 39b available to commercial users during times when it is not needed by the space launch system 56 as of may 2017[update nasa has one sls mission scheduled in 2019 and a second one in 2021.[56 launch pad 39c launch pad 39c is a new facility for smaller launch vehicles built in 2015 within the launch complex 39b perimeter construction construction of the pad began in january 2015 and was completed in june 2015 kennedy space center director robert d cabana and representatives from the ground systems development and operations gsdo program and the center planning and development cpd and engineering directorates marked the completion of the new pad during a ribbon-cutting ceremony july 17 2015 as america's premier spaceport we're always looking for new and innovative ways to meet america's launch needs and one area that was missing was small class payloads  robert d cabana said using 21st century funds we built pad 39c 8 gsdo oversaw the project and is working with cpd to grow commercial space efforts at kennedy 8 pad 39c is the latest addition to our portfolio of launch pads  said scott colloredo cpd director the small class market is here the demand for that kind of launcher is increasing the key here is this is really what a launch site for a small class launcher needs to look like 8 the concrete pad measures about 50 feet 15 m wide by about 100 feet 30 m long and could support the combined weight of a fueled launch vehicle payload and customer-provided launch mount up to about 132,000 pounds 60,000 kg and an umbilical tower structure fluid lines cables and umbilical arms weighing up to about 47,000 pounds 21,000 kg 8 gsdo also developed a universal propellant servicing system to provide liquid oxygen and liquid methane fueling capabilities for a variety of small class rockets 8 this is absolutely great to designate a new pad within the confines of pad 39b i'm looking forward to having customers here in the not too distant future making use of this outstanding facility  robert d cabana said[8 capabilities kscs newest launch pad designated 39c is designed to accommodate small class vehicles located in the southeast area of the launch complex 39b perimeter this new concrete pad measures about 50 feet 15 m wide by about 100 feet 30 m long launch complex 39c will serve as a multi-purpose site allowing companies to test vehicles and capabilities in the smaller class of rockets making it more affordable for smaller companies to break into the commercial spaceflight market as part of this capability nasas ground systems development and operations program developed a universal propellant servicing system which can provide liquid oxygen and liquid methane fueling capabilities for a variety of small class rockets this system is slated for operational readiness in the summer of 2016.[8 with the addition of launch complex 39c ksc can offer the following processing and launching features for companies working with small class vehicles maximum thrust up to 200,000 pounds-force 890 kn 71 processing facilities  i e vehicle assembly building
