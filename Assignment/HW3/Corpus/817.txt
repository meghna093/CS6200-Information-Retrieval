and damaging tropical cyclone that affected eastern and central portions of the united states gulf coast in late august and early september 1985 threatening popular tourist destinations during labor day weekend elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent the hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern florida and eastern louisiana though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas elena developed on august 28 near cuba and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact it entered the gulf of mexico and continued to strengthen initially projected to strike the central gulf coast the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on august 30 then stalled just 50 mi 80 km west of cedar key florida despite predictions that elena would continue eastward across florida the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near biloxi mississippi on september 2 as a category 3 major hurricane the storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on september 4 the hurricane's unpredictable shifts in direction created what was considered the largest peacetime evacuation in the nation's history evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storm's forecast positions and many residents and tourists along portions of the gulf coast were forced to leave twice in a matter of days preparations were generally timely and efficient though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin and many refugees tried to return home against officials orders about 1.25 million people fled the storm in florida alone contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees tropical cyclone warnings and watches were continuously issued and adjusted and forecasters stressed the storm's destructive potential for days elena's slow movement off western florida resulted in severe beach erosion and damage to coastal buildings roads and seawalls especially to those of old or inadequate construction destruction was greatest near the shore and on islands such as cedar key and dog island though tornadoes spawned by the hurricane swept through communities and mobile home parks well inland the hurricane devastated the apalachicola bay shellfish industry killing large quantities of oysters destroying their reefs and leaving thousands of workers unemployed farther west dauphin island in alabama endured wind gusts as high as 130 mph 210 km h and a significant storm surge the island sustained some of the most significant damage inflicted by elena including several hundred damaged or demolished homes the rest of the state's coast also sustained considerable damage and the inland pecan and soybean crops were severely diminished in alabama and mississippi over 13,000 homes were damaged in mississippi and 200 were destroyed cities close to the alabama borderincluding pascagoulaexperienced widespread damage to residences schools and businesses and the community of gautier was effectively isolated from the outside world several apparent but unconfirmed tornadoes appear to have exacerbated the damage in the gulfport area wind damage extended into portions of eastern louisiana overall nine people died as a result of the hurricane two in texas due to drownings in rip currents three in florida two in louisiana one in arkansas and one in a maritime accident in the gulf of mexico damage totaled about 1.3 billion 1 and power outages from the storm affected 550,000 people in elena's wake president ronald reagan declared parts of alabama mississippi and florida federal disaster areas making storm victims eligible for financial aid and temporary housing the name elena was later retired from the cyclical list of atlantic hurricane names because of the storm's effects meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale the origins of hurricane elena trace to an easterly tropical wave that was first identified off the western coast of africa on august 23 1985 the system sped westward across the atlantic at up to 35 mph 56 km h its rapid motion combined with the presence of an unusually hostile saharan air layer prevented tropical cyclogenesis for several days driven by a strong subtropical ridge to its north the wave quickly approached north america as it began to show signs of organization at 00:00 utc on august 28 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression while over the windward passage the newly designated depression began to track west-northwestward over cuba which is known to disrupt tropical cyclone development despite that its central barometric pressure continued to deepen and reconnaissance aircraft found winds exceeding 50 mph 80 km h near the center in response the national hurricane center upgraded the depression to tropical storm elena over northern cuba later on august 28.
