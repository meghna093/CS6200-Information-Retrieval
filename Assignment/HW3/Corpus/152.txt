wave setup  wikipediain fluid dynamics wave setup is the increase in mean water level due to the presence of breaking waves similarly wave setdown is a wave-induced decrease of the mean water level before the waves break during the shoaling process for short the whole phenomenon is often denoted as wave setup including both increase and decrease of mean elevation this setup is primarily present in and near the coastal surf zone besides a spatial variation in the mean wave setup also a variation in time may be present  known as surf beat  causing infragravity wave radiation wave setup can be mathematically modeled by considering the variation in radiation stress longuet-higgins  stewart 1962 radiation stress is the tensor of excess horizontal-momentum fluxes due to the presence of the waves in and near the coastal surf zone as a progressive wave approaches shore and the water depth decreases the wave height increases due to wave shoaling as a result there is additional wave-induced flux of horizontal momentum the horizontal momentum equations of the mean flow requires this additional wave-induced flux to be balanced this causes a decrease in the mean water level before the waves break called a setdown after the waves break the wave energy flux is no longer constant but decreasing due to energy dissipation the radiation stress therefore decreases after the break point causing a free surface level increase to balance wave setup both of the above descriptions are specifically for beaches with mild bed slope wave setup is particularly of concern during storm events when the effects of big waves generated by wind from the storm are able to increase the mean sea level by wave setup enhancing the risks of damage to coastal infrastructure references longuet-higgins m s
